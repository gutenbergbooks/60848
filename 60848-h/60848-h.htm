  <h2 class='c002'>BLACKFOOT MYTHOLOGY.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c003'><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The Blackfoot Indian Confederacy comprises the Piegan, Blood,
and Blackfoot tribes. Each tribe is located on its own reservation,
and the three reservations are within the provisional district of
Alberta. The separation of the tribes, the rapid settlement of the
country by the white people, the death of many of the old chiefs,
and the depressed spirits of the people have seriously impaired the
purity of the folk-lore of the natives. The following fragments were
gathered from the lips of the Blood Indians, as I sat in their lodges
with note-book in hand. The younger members of the tribe could
not be relied upon to relate these myths accurately. Those I have
given have been repeatedly verified by the aged members of the
tribe.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CREATION MYTH.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Napioa, the <em>Old Man</em>, floated upon a log in the waters, and had
with him four animals: Mameo, the fish; Matcekûpis, the frog;
Maniskeo, the lizard; and Spopeo, the turtle. He sent them down
into the waters in the order named, to see what they could find.
The first three descended, but never returned; the turtle, however,
arose with his mouth full of mud. Napioa took the mud from the
mouth of the turtle, rolled it around in the hollow of his hand, and
in this manner made the earth, which fell into the waters, and afterward
grew to its present size.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was only one person named Napioa. He lived in the world
when the people who dwelt with him had two heads. He did not
make these people, although he made the world, and how they came
upon the earth no one knows. The Bloods do not know where
Napioa came from. They do not know whether he was an Indian
or not. He was not the ancestor of the Blackfeet, but the Creator
of the Indian race. He was double-jointed. He is not dead, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>is living in a great sea in the south. He did not make the white
people, and the Indians do not know who made them.</p>

<p class='c007'>After he made the earth, he first made a woman. Her mouth was
slit vertically, and he was not satisfied, so he closed it, and recut
it in the same shape as it has remained till to-day. Afterward he
made several women, and then he made several men. The men
lived together, but separate from the women, and they did not see
the women for some time. When the men first saw the women they
were astonished and somewhat afraid. Napioa told them to take
one woman each, but they were afraid. He encouraged them, and
then they each took a wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Napioa made the buffalo. They were quite tame. He gave bows
and arrows to the Indians and told them to shoot the buffalo. They
did so; and as the buffalo were tame, they killed a large number.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>ORIGIN OF THE WIND.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The stories differ. Some say that it is caused by a very large
deer which dwells in the mountains; others, that there are large
cattle in the mountains, who roar loudly and thus cause the wind
to blow; and again others, that it is caused by a large bird flapping
its wings in the mountains.  The prevailing form is the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>Napioa at one time had with him the wolf as his companion. He
also had with him an owl, which he employed to look for things for
him when it was dark. As he was travelling around he saw a lodge
in which were a man and a woman. In this lodge were two bags;
one contained the winter and the other the summer. He told the
owl to look in and see what there was inside the lodge, and when
he looked he saw the two bags. Napioa said that he was going to
place some months in each bag, and make the summer and winter
of equal length. He went inside, and the woman had a long piece
of ice. He failed to accomplish his purpose. He came out of the
lodge determined to gain possession of the summer and winter bags.
He told the prairie chicken to steal the bags, and it got hold of the
summer bag and escaped. Being pursued by the man and woman,
the prairie chicken hid in the long grass. The man and woman cut
the long grass to get the bag. The chicken clung close to the earth,
and had part of the extremity of its body taken off. In the struggle
the bag burst, and a very strong wind sprang up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some time after this, Napioa, having burnt himself, was anxious
for a wind to blow to cool himself. He went up to the top of a
mountain and began “making medicine,” and the wind soon began
to blow. It blew so hard that he had to hold on to the bushes, but
they were torn up by the roots. At last he caught hold of a birch
tree and firmly clung to it, so that by the force of the wind and his
weight marks were left upon the bark of the tree.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>THE BLOOD-CLOT BOY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There lived, a long time ago, an old man and his wife, who had
three daughters and one son-in-law. One day, as the mother was
cooking some meat, she threw a clot of blood into the pot containing
the meat. The pot began to boil, and then there issued from
it a peculiar hissing noise. The old woman looked into the pot, and
was surprised to see that the blood-clot had become transformed
into a little boy. Quickly he grew, and in a few moments he sprang
from the pot, a full-grown young man. The father and mother were
delighted, but the son-in-law was angry and jealous. The name of
the blood-clot boy was Kûtoyĭs. The son-in-law was a lazy, badtempered
young man, who made the old man hunt the buffalo, procure
the wood, and carry the water. He had a lodge of his own,
where he dwelt with his wife. When the old man brought in the
meat he threw it down in his lodge; and no sooner had he placed it
there than the son-in-law came and took whatever he needed, oftentimes
leaving the old man and his family in want. The old man
brought in wood and water for his family, and the son-in-law took
what he wanted. Sometimes the old man and his family were compelled
to suffer, because as he was old he could not work very hard,
and all that he had was taken from him. The son-in-law would not
hunt, but depended altogether upon the old man to support him.
Kûtoyĭs went out to hunt with his father, and he proved himself to
be an expert hunter. He saw a fine fat buffalo cow, and he killed
it. He procured abundance of meat for his father, and he carried
it home for him. He would not allow the old man to do any work.
He filled his lodge with meat. He then went out and got a large
supply of wood and water. As Kûtoyĭs and his father were walking
together, they heard the son-in-law scolding. The old man was
afraid. Kûtoyĭs told his father not to be afraid. He told him to
say to his son-in-law that he could not get any of the meat, wood,
or water. If he threatened to kill him, he was to answer him in
the same manner. The son-in-law came to the old man’s lodge and
began to remove the meat. The old man told him to leave it alone.
He threatened to kill the old man, and the father-in-law angrily retorted
that he would kill him. The son-in-law became very angry,
and ran to his lodge for his bow and arrows. When he had procured
them he returned, scolding and threatening; and as he reached the
old man’s lodge, Kûtoyĭs, who had been hiding behind the lodge,
sprang in front of the old man, and the two men fought. Kûtoyĭs
drew his bow and killed his brother-in-law dead. After his death the
old man and his family had peace and abundance of food. The son-in-law
had no distinguishing name. Kûtoyĭs sought to drive out all
the evil in the world, and to unite the people and make them happy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>The fathers and mothers in the camp told this story to their children
to hush them to sleep.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>NAPIOA.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Napioa is the Secondary Creator of the Indians. There are two
kinds of stories told concerning him. One class reveals him in the
character of a good man, and the other class as a bad man. He is
not, however, a man, but a supernatural being, able to perform deeds
which no human being could perform. The Indians do not know
the manner of his birth, nor the place from whence he came. He is
still living in a great sea away in the south. He made his home
for a long time at the source of the Old Man’s River, in Alberta,
where may be seen the lake from which he drank, the stones which
he threw along the ground when he was sporting, and the indentations
in the ground showing where he lay. At the Red Deer River
there is a high ridge, where there is a land-slide, down which Napioa
slid as a toboggan slide.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, as he was travelling across the prairie, he saw a bird
which threw its eyes upward, and said, “Tuhu!” As he came up
to the place where the bird was, he said, “Let me see how you do
that?” After being told to repeat this word and throw his head
back, he felt quite elated. He was so much overjoyed that he threw
his eyes up repeatedly. He was standing under a tree, and as he
threw his eyes upward they were caught in the branches of the tree,
and he lost his sight. He then went off alone. As he wandered on
his journey he kept beckoning in different directions, so that if any
one saw him he would receive help and find his people. A woman
saw him throwing his arms about as if desiring some one to come to
him, and at once she went and asked him what he wanted. He said,
“Take me to the place where the people are.” She took him and
led him along by means of a stick, the woman going in front and
Napioa following. He was afraid that she might leave him, so he
tied a bell to her dress, that he might follow her should she try to
escape. Nothing eventful happened until they crossed a river, when
he inquired, “Are there any buffalo to be seen?” The woman answered,
“Yes, there are some at the river now.” He told her to
point his arrow toward the buffalo, that he might shoot one. She
did so; but he missed the buffalo, and then he shouted that the
arrow did not belong to him. Again he commanded her to point
an arrow in the right direction; but the buffalo were not killed, and
again he asserted that the arrow did not belong to him. After several
attempts he shot a buffalo, and then called out, “That was my
arrow.” He bade the woman skin the animal, cut up the meat, and
bring it to the camping ground. While she was doing this he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>that he would put up the lodge. He sought the lodge-poles; and
as he brought them one by one, he failed to find those that he had
already placed on the ground. He had quite a number of lodge-poles
arranged here and there, but owing to his blindness he could
not collect them. When the woman returned she asked him why
he had so many poles, and none arranged in their proper places.
“That you might choose the best ones,” he replied. Thus was
Napioa ever crafty, never allowing any one to say that there was
anything wrong with him. The lodge being prepared, and supper
ended, Napioa went to sleep. As he lay with his hair drawn over
his eyes, the curiosity of the woman tempted her to lift the hair that
she might see his face. As she slowly lifted his locks she gazed into
the empty sockets from which his eyes had been torn, and suddenly
seized with terror, she fled from the lodge and sped her way through
the darkness. Napioa heard the bell, and springing from his grassy
bed, pursued her, guided by the ringing of the bell. She ran in
different directions; but he was fast gaining upon her when she
tore the bell from her dress, and as she threw it one way she ran
in another direction, and thus escaped from the wiles of Napioa.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dwellers in the Western lodges have many legends relating to
places of historical interest in the country, and these throw a flood
of light on the religious ideas, migrations, social and domestic customs,
political life, and other matters of interest connected with the
tribes comprising the Blackfoot Confederacy. Some of the legends
are local, and when told by the aged men as they sit around their
camp-fires, vary somewhat in detail according to the intellectual ability,
inventiveness, and strength of memory of the narrator. I have
listened to some of these legends as told over and over again for the
past nine years, and I find that the young men are not able to relate
them as accurately as the aged; besides, as the country is becoming
settled with white people, they are less disposed to tell to others
their native religious ideas, lest they are laughed at because of not
believing the same things as their superior brethren of the white
race. As the children grow up they are forgetting these things, and
the years are not far distant when the folk-lore of the Blackfeet will
be greatly changed, and many of their traditions forgotten.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE LEGEND OF SHEEP CREEK.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Napioa, the Old Man, the Secondary Creator of the Blackfeet, was
travelling one day with the Kit-Fox, near Sheep Creek, which is
located about twenty-five miles south of Calgary, in the Provisional
District of Alberta. As they travelled together they saw a large
rock, and Napioa felt constrained to make an offering of his robe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>to it. He presented the robe, and, with the Kit-Fox as his companion,
departed. He had not proceeded far upon the way, when
perceiving that it was going to rain, he told his companion to return
and ask the rock to give him back his robe, as he was afraid of being
drenched with the rain. The rock refused to give the robe to the
Kit-Fox, and then Napioa, becoming angry, said: “That old rock has
been there for a long time and never had a robe. It has always been
poor. I will go back myself and take away my robe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He returned and took the robe by force, and then the rock became
very angry, and followed them, determined to punish them. Napioa
fled south toward High River, and the Kit-Fox, anxious for his own
safety, hid in a hole in the ground. Napioa saw an old buffalo bull,
and he called to him for help; but when the buffalo came to his
rescue the rock ran over him and crushed him to death. Then two
bears came to help Napioa, and they two were killed by the rock.
Two small birds with very large, strong bills came to help him, and
they attacked the rock, breaking off pieces from it as they suddenly
pounced upon it and then flew upward. In a short time they killed
the rock, and Napioa was saved. The Indians then named the stream
“Oqkotoqseetûqta” (the Rock Creek, or Stony Creek), but it is called
by the white people at the present day “Sheep Creek.”</p>

<h3 class='c005'>LEGEND OF TONGUE CREEK.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Tongue Creek is situated between Sheep Creek and High River,
about nine miles south of Sheep Creek. In the distant past, Napioa
was travelling in the vicinity of Tongue Creek, when he espied a
band of elk sporting themselves on its banks. They came to a place
where the bank was steep, and they all leaped down, seeking a sandy
resting-place in the bed of the stream. Napioa reached the creek,
and lighting a piece of wood, he threw the firebrand over the bank.
The elk heard him, and asked him what he wanted. “Oh,” said he,
“I was laughing when you spoke to me, and I could not answer:
but that is a very nice spot down there, and I want to go down, for
there is an abundance of beautiful clean sand.” When the elk saw
the firebrand they became frightened, and rushing headlong over
each other, broke their necks. A single young elk escaped; but
Napioa said, “Never mind, there are many more elk in the country;
that one can go.” Napioa pitched his lodge and erected a pole with
a flag upon it. He skinned the elk, filled his lodge with the meat,
and made preparations to camp there and have a feast. While thus
engaged, a coyote entered his lodge and asked him for something to
eat, but he would not give any. He noticed that the coyote had on a
necklace of shells, and said, “If you will give me that necklace, I will
give you something to eat.” The coyote replied, “I can’t do that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>for this is my medicine [amulet], and it is very strong.” “Well, I
will run a race with you, and if you beat me I will give you some of
the meat.” But the coyote refused, and as he did so he held out a
bandaged foot, and the two went on together, the coyote protesting
that his foot was sore, and he could not run. He managed to get
Napioa a long distance from the lodge, and then quickly unloosing
the bandage from his foot, he ran back to the lodge. Napioa followed
a long distance behind, shouting, “Save me some of the meat!”
When the coyote reached the lodge he called aloud for his fellow-coyotes,
who speedily came and devoured all the meat. Napioa had
placed the tongues on the top of the pole, but a mouse ran up the
pole and ate them all. When Napioa found that all the meat was
gone, he said, “Then I shall have the tongues, for the coyote could
not get them.” But as he took down the remaining portions he
threw them away, saying, “They are bad food.” The Indians call
this creek “Matsinawûstam” (Tongue Flag), but the white people
call it “Tongue Creek.”</p>

<h3 class='c005'>LEGEND OF RED COULEE.</h3>

<p class='c006'>There lies in a “coulee” near the Marias River, on the road that
leads from Macleod to Benton, a large “medicine stone,” venerated
by the Indians belonging to the Blackfoot Confederacy. The “coulee”
is named by the Indians the “Red Coulee.” When the Blackfeet
came from the north, the Snake Indians, who at that time inhabited
the country, told the Blackfeet that there was a large medicine
stone on the top of a hill, close to a ravine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several years after they were told this, a Blackfoot chief with fifty
men went southward on the war-path. They all went to this stone,
and the chief, being sceptical about the mysterious powers possessed
by it, laughed at his men for exhibiting such childishness as to believe
in it. In derision he hurled the stone down the mountain-side
into the ravine and then departed. They engaged in a battle with
some Indians in the south, and all of them were killed, only one man
returning to tell the fate of his comrades. Ever since that time the
Indians have called the place the “Red Coulee,” and as they travel
to and fro they never forget to go there and present their offerings,
to insure safety in battle and protection by the way.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>LEGEND OF THE RED STONE.</h3>

<p class='c006'>On the river flat at the mouth of one of the ravines at Lethbridge,
and not many yards distant from the coal mine, lies a stone, which
oftentimes I have seen painted and surrounded by numerous Indian
trinkets which had been given to it by the Indians. The Blood Indians
call it “Mikiotoûqse” (The Red Stone). Tradition states that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>a long time ago a young man lay down beside this stone and fell
asleep, and as he lay there he dreamed that the stone spoke to him
and said, “Am I the Red Stone?” And the young man said, “Yes,
you are the Red Stone.” When he awoke he felt that this must be
a mysterious stone that could thus converse with him, and he made
offerings to it. Until the present day these offerings are made, the
Indians believing that by giving to it reverence they will be blessed
in all things that concern them in this life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the Blackfeet there are several traditions which the writer
was unable to obtain, as only a few of the older men possessed the
knowledge sufficient to relate them accurately, and they seemed to
be unwilling at the time to impart the information. The following
were mentioned as myths of the people: the Myth of Asinakopi,
or the Great Snake; the Great Bear Myth; the Lesser Bear; the
Morning Star; the Man and Woman in the Moon.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are also songs of historical importance, some relating to
love, war, and one of traditional significance. The writer learned
from Jerry Potts, a Piegan Indian, who is government interpreter,
and from some of the Blood Indians, that there was a historical
song which from the account given concerning it resembled the
Song of Hiawatha. An aged chief named Manistokos, the Father
of Many Children, was said to know it thoroughly, but never at any
time was the author able to obtain possession of it. Joe Healey, a
Blood Indian, who speaks English well, having lived when a boy
with an Indian trader, who sent him to school, informed the writer
that there were several secret societies among the Blackfoot tribes,
the members of which had traditions of interest relating to their
people. Only those who were initiated could obtain the revelation
of these stories of mythological import. In relation to their social
organization, the taboos of the gentes reveal facts of special significance
to the mythology of the Blackfeet. The stories relating to
the origin of the names of the gentes shed light upon the migrations
and religious ideas of the people, but this phase of their traditions
comes properly under the study of their social organization. Such
names as Netsepoye, the people who speak the same language, the
name of the Blackfoot Confederacy, Kaina, the name of the Blood
Indians, the origin and significance of which is unknown, and Apikûnĭ,
the name of the Piegans, are of traditional importance. The
separation of the tribes in late years has modified their mythology,
but the basis of the myths remains the same.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>ONONDAGA TALES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c005'>GRANDMOTHER O-NE-HA-TAH, MOTHER OO-KWA-E, AND THE LOST BOY.</h3>

<p class='c006'>I had this story of the Lost Boy from the Rev. Albert Cusick, a
native Onondaga, and the first part is very nearly as he wrote it out.
The latter part he told me, and I took it down.</p>

<p class='c007'>A long time ago, among the Onondaga Indians, were several families
who went off to camp near the wildwood streams, where fish,
deer, bear, otter, beaver, and other like game could be caught for
winter use. These Onondagas, or People of the Hill, journeyed several
days, and finally came to the hunting-grounds. The hunting-ground
where they stopped was a very beautiful place, with its little
hills and the river with high banks. Not far from their camp was a
beautiful lake, with high rocky banks, and with little islands full of
cedar-trees. When they came there it was in the moon or month
of <em>Chut-ho-wa-ah</em>, or October. Some of these Indians made their
camps near the river, and some near the lake. As it was quite early
in the season for hunting, some of the Indians amused themselves
by making birch-bark canoes. With these they could go up and
down the river and on the lakes, fishing and trapping, or making
deadfalls for smaller game.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the party were five little boys, who had their own bows and
arrows, and would go hunting, imitating their fathers and uncles.
Among them was one much smaller than the rest, who was greatly
teased by the older boys. Sometimes they would run away from
him and hide themselves in the woods, leaving him crying; then
they would come back and show themselves, and have a great laugh
over the little boy’s distress. Sometimes they would run for the
camp, and would tell him that a bear or a wolf was chasing them,
leaving the little boy far behind, crying with all his might. Many a
time he sought his father’s camp alone, when the other boys would
leave him and hide themselves in the woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day these little Indians found a great hollow log lying on the
ground. One of them said, “Maybe there is a <em>Ta-hone-tah-na-ken</em>
[rabbit] or a <em>Hi-sen</em> [red squirrel] in this hollow log. Let us shoot
into it, and see if there is any <em>Ta-hone-tah-na-ken</em> in it.” All agreed
to this, and they began to take the little boy’s arrows from him and
shoot them into the hole; then the larger boys said to him, “Now
go into the hollow log, and get your arrows.” The little boy said,
“No; I am afraid something might catch me.” Then he began to
cry, and was not at all willing to go into the log. The others coaxed
him to do so, and one said he would get his uncle to make him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>new bow and arrows if he would go into the hollow log, and get
the arrows they had shot there. At last this tempted the little boy.
He stopped crying, got down on his hands and knees, and crawled
into the log. When he had gone in a little way, he found one of his
arrows, and handed it out. This gave him courage to go in a little
farther. When he had advanced some distance in the log, one of
the larger boys said, “Let’s stop up the log, and trap that boy in
it, so that he can’t get out.” This was soon agreed to, and the boys
began to fetch old rotten wood and old limbs, stopping up the hollow,
and trapping the little boy in it. When this mischief was done,
the four boys ran to their camp, not saying a word about the little
boy who was trapped in the log.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was two days before the mother<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c003'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and father began to notice
the absence of their boy, for they thought he must have stayed over
night with one of the others, as very often he had done; but the
second day a search was begun, and the other four boys were asked
whereabouts they had left him. They all said that they did not
know, and that the last time they were out the little boy did not go
with them. Then the entire camp turned out to join in the search,
as now they knew that the boy must be lost. After they had hunted
a long time he could not be found, and they ceased to look for him;
they thought he must have been killed and eaten by a wolf or a bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he was first shut up in the log the little boy tried to get out,
but could not do it, as the chunks of rotten wood were too large for
him to move. He could not kick or push them out. Then he cried
for help, but no one came. There he was for three days and three
nights, crying loudly for help, and now and then falling asleep. But
on the fourth night, while he was in the hollow log, he thought he
heard some one coming. He listened, and was sure he heard the
crying of a very old woman and the noise of the tramping of human
feet. The crying and the tramping came nearer and nearer to the
log where he was. At last the crying came very close to him, and
then he heard a noise, as though some one sat down on the log.
Now he heard the old woman cry in earnest, and now and then she
would say: “Oh, how tired I am! how tired I am! and yet I may
have come too late, for I do not hear my grandchild cry. He may
be dead! he may be dead!” Then the old woman would cry in
earnest again. At last he heard a rap on the log and his own name
called: “Ha-yah-noo! Ha-yah-noo! are you still alive?” Ha-yah-noo,
or Footprints under the Water (for this was the name of the little lost
boy), answered the old woman, and said that he still lived. The old
woman said, “Oh, how glad I am to find my grandchild still alive!”
Then she asked Ha-yah-noo if he could not get out; but he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>he could not, for he had already tried. Then said the old woman,
“I will try to get you out of this log.” He heard her pull at the
chunks of old wood; but at last she said she could not get him out,
as she was too old and tired. She had heard him crying three days
before, and had journeyed three days and nights to come and help
her grandchild out of his trouble. Now this old woman was an O-ne-ha-tah,
or Porcupine. She lived in an old hemlock tree near the
spot where the boy was shut up in the log.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c003'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>When Grandmother O-ne-ha-tah had said that she had to journey
three days and nights, and now she could not help Ha-yah-noo out
of the log, she was very sorry, and began to cry again. Finally she
said that she had three children, who were very strong, and that she
would get them to help her; so she went after them. It was almost
daylight when they came, and then Ha-yah-noo heard them pull out
the chunks which stopped up the log. At last Grandmother O-ne-ha-tah
said to Ha-yah-noo: “Come out now. My children have got
the chunks out of the log. You can come out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Ha-yah-noo came out, he saw four wild animals around him.
There was Grandmother O-ne-ha-tah and her three children, as she
called them. They were Oo-kwa-e, the Bear; Sken-no-doh, the Deer;
and Tah-you-ne, the Wolf. “Now,” said O-ne-ha-tah, “I want one of
you to take care of this boy, and love him as your own child. You
all know that I have got to be very, very old. If I were younger I
would take care of him myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tah-you-ne, the Wolf, was the first one to speak. She said she
could take care of the boy, as she lived on the same meat on which
he fed. “No,” said Grandmother O-ne-ha-tah, “you are too greedy.
You would eat up the boy as soon as he is left with you alone.” The
Wolf was very angry. She showed her teeth, and snapped them at
the boy, who was very much afraid, and wanted no such mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next that spoke was Sken-no-doh, the Deer. She said that
she and her husband would take care of the boy, as they lived on
corn and other things which they knew the boy liked. Her husband
would carry him on his back wherever they went. But Grandmother
O-ne-ha-tah said: “No; you can’t take care of the boy, for
you are always travelling, and never stay in one place. The boy
cannot do the travelling that you do, for you run very fast and make
very long journeys. The boy cannot stand it, and you have no home
for him for the winter. Boys like this have homes.” Then the Deer
ran away, very happy, as though she were glad to be rid of the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Oo-kwa-e, the Bear, said that she knew she could take care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>of the boy, as she lived in a large stone house and had plenty to eat.
She lived on meats and fishes, and all kinds of nuts and berries, and
even wild honey, all of which the boy would like. She had a good
warm bed for him to sleep on through the winter, and she was a
loving mother to her children. She would rather die than see
them abused. Then O-ne-ha-tah, or Porcupine (meaning “Full of
quills”), said: “You are just the right one to take care of this boy.
Take him and carry him home.” So the Bear, like a loving mother,
took the boy and brought him to her home. When they got there,
Oo-kwa-e said to her two children, the Oo-tutch-ha, or Young Bears,
“Don’t play with him roughly, and he will be your kind little
brother.” Then she gave him some berries to eat, and they were all
happy together.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stone house was a cave in the rocks, but to the little boy
it seemed to have rooms like any other house, and the little bears
seemed to him like human children. They did not tease him, but
lived in the most friendly way, and the old Oo-kwa-e was a very kind
mother to the boy. It was now quite late in the fall, and the days
became short and dark. Then Mother Oo-kwa-e said: “It is late
and dark now. We had better go to bed.” The nights were cold,
but the bed was warm, and they slept until the spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening it thundered; for the bears do not wake up until the
thunder is heard. It made such a noise that they thought the walls
were coming down. Then the old Oo-kwa-e said: “Why, it’s getting
light. We had better get up.” So they lived happily together for a
very long time. She went out in the woods, going to and fro for
food, and the children amused themselves at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every now and then, through the summer, the Bear people would
come in and say, “In such a place are plenty of berries.” These
would be strawberries, raspberries, or others, according to the season.
Later they told of chestnuts and other kinds of nuts, of which
they were fond. Then they would say, “Let us go and gather them.”
So the Mother Bear and the little Bears went, taking the little boy
along with them; for they always expected a good time. The other
bears knew nothing about the little boy. When they came near the
spot, and he was seen, these would be frightened, and say: “There
is a human being! Let us run! let us run!” So they would scamper
off as fast as bears can, leaving their heaps of nuts or berries behind
them. Then the old Oo-kwa-e would gather these up, she and her
children, and take them home, which was a very easy way of getting
plenty of food. Thus the boy became very useful to Mother Bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy lived with them thus for about three years, and the same
things happened every year. In the third year Mother Bear said,
“Some one is coming to kill us.” Then all looked out, and saw a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>man coming through the woods, with his bow and arrows in his hand,
and his dog running all around looking for game. Then Mother Bear
said, “I must see what I can do.” So she took a forked stick, and
pointed the open fork towards the man. It seemed to come near
him, and appeared to him like a line of thick brush that he did not
wish to break through. So he turned aside, and went another way,
and they were safe that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another day she again said, “Some one is coming towards us
again, and we shall be killed.” She put forth the forked stick again;
but the man did not mind it, and came straight towards her stone
house. The stick itself split, and there was nothing in the way.
Then she took a bag of feathers and threw these outside. They flew
up and down, and around and around, and seemed like a flock of
partridges. The dog ran after them, through the bushes and trees,
supposing them to be birds, and so the second man went away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The days went by, and the third time Mother Bear saw a man
coming. This time she said, “Now we certainly are all going to
die.” Then she said to the boy: “Your father is coming now, and
he is too good a hunter to be fooled. There is his dog, with his
four eyes, and he, too, is one of the best of hunters.” Now when
a dog has light spots over each eye, the Indians say that he has four
eyes. So the man came nearer, and she tried the forked stick, but
it split; and still the man and dog came on. Then she scattered
the feathers, and they flew around as before; but the hunter and
dog paid no attention to them, and still they both came on. At last
the dog reached the door and barked, and the man drew his bow to
shoot at anything that came out.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Mother Oo-kwa-e saw the man standing there, she said,
“Now, children, we must all take our bundles and go.” So each of
the Bears took a small bundle and laid it on its back, but there was
no bundle at all for the boy. When all were ready, Mother Oo-kwa-e
said, “I will go first, whatever may happen.” So she opened the
door, and as she went out the man shot, and she was killed. Then
the oldest of the Oo-tutch-ha said, “I will go next;” and as he went
he also was killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last little Bear was afraid, and said to the boy, “You go
first.” But the little boy was afraid, too, and said: “No; you go
first. I have no bundle.” For all the Bears tried to get their bundles
between them and the man. So the little Bear and the boy at
last went out together; but though the Bear tried to keep behind,
the man shot at him first, and he was killed. As the hunter was
about to shoot again, the boy called out: “Don’t shoot me! don’t
shoot me! I am not a bear!” His father dropped his arrow, for
he knew his voice at once, and said: “Why did you not call out before?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Then I would not have killed the Oo-kwa-e and Oo-tutch-ha.
I am very sorry for what I have done, for the Bears have been good
to you.” But the boy said: “You did not kill the Bears, though
you thought so. You only shot the bundles. I saw them thrown
down, and the spirits of the Bears run off from behind them.” Still,
the man was sorry he had shot at the Bears, for he wished to be
kind to them, as they had been to his boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the father began to look at his boy more closely, to see how
he had grown and how he had changed. Then he saw that long hairs
were growing between his fingers, for, living so long with them, he
had already begun to turn into a Bear. He was very glad when he
took the boy back to his home, and his friends and relatives, and the
whole town, rejoiced with him. All day they had a great feast, and
all night they danced, and they were still dancing when I came away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bear stories of this kind seem to have been favorites among the
Iroquois, and Mrs. Erminnie A. Smith relates three of them in her
collection. Of such tales in general, she remarks that, “In nearly
all of these, wherever the bear is introduced he serves as a pattern
of benevolence, while many other animals, such as the porcupine,
are always presented as noxious.” Yet in the one most resembling
the one just given, “The Hare and his Step-son,” the man shuts
the child in a porcupine’s hole, and the porcupine rescues him, calling
on the animals to feed him. The fox and the wolf, however, do
not bear a good character, and snakes are invariably agents of evil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old story of “Valentine and Orson” has so delighted white
children that it is no matter of surprise that Indians have enjoyed
their own stories of lost boys nursed by bears. Perhaps the tendency
of these animals to assume an erect position may have suggested
to them a near kinship to the human race. To complete the
present paper, a sketch may be given of the three tales related by
Mrs. Smith. It may be premised that several incidents of the present
story are found in all three of these, but not in each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first she had from the Senecas of the Cattaraugus reservation.
In this a young boy is missed from the hunting-camp, and all
search proves vain. His friends think him dead, and go home. A
bear takes pity on him, but changes herself into the appearance of a
woman, and takes him home to live with her cubs, in her hollow
tree. When the time for the return of the hunters arrives, she tells
him of her device, and he is restored to his friends. He never kills
a bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next is quite different. A hunter is angry with his wife for
secreting food, and makes her eat until she dies from its effects.
Her new-born child he throws into a hollow tree, but takes good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>care of his older boy. For him he makes a bow and arrows, and
after a long time saw little footprints around his lodge. He made a
second small bow and arrows, and soon found they were being used.
He now saw a little child come from the hollow tree to play with his
boy, and knew it was the infant he had thrown away. He had been
cared for by a bear, whom the hunter treated kindly. The two boys
afterwards went far westward to slay the great and hurtful beasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third was told in Canada, and is a variant of the one I have
related. A man hated his step-son, and persuaded him to enter a
porcupine’s hole. This he stopped up, leaving the boy a prisoner.
He cried himself asleep, and when he woke up he was in a room
with an old woman, who was the porcupine. He could not eat her
food, and so she called the animals to a council to tell how he might
be fed. “The fox said: ‘I live on geese and fowls. I’ll take him,
but still he can’t eat raw food.’ The council decided that it was
useless for him to assume the charge.” All offered in turn, without
effect. At last the bear spoke, and the child was left with her, all
agreeing to help her gather nuts. After living several years in a hollow
tree, they saw a man and dog coming. The tree was cut down,
and the bear and her two cubs were killed. The hunter looked for
another cub, but found the boy instead. He made noises just like
the cubs. The hunter took him home, tamed and taught him, and
gave him his daughter for a wife. Her mother, however, was angry
because the boy brought home no bear’s meat. At last he killed a
bear, but it brought him no good luck. On his way home he fell on
a sharp stick, which killed him at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this tale the words of the fox are much like those of the wolf
in the other. Some of the incidents differ much, and yet the common
origin of the two is readily seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>In New York the Iroquois stories are becoming increasingly difficult
to obtain. They maintain their hold among the older people,
but the younger ones find those which are quite as good among the
literature of the whites. It is easy to see how our stories are adopted,
and told in an Indian way; and Mrs. Smith has given some good examples.
The Onondagas are not behind in following the spirit of the
times.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE FOX AND THE BEAR.</h3>

<p class='c006'>While the fox is the type of all mischief with the Onondagas, they
seem to have few stories about him. One of these has been related
by Mrs. E. A. Smith, and has modern features. In this she makes
one story depend upon another, while they were related to me as distinct
tales. I inquired particularly about this, and was assured that
there was no connection. These are the tales I received:—</p>

<p class='c007'>I. The fox saw some men carrying home a wagon load of fish, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>contrived to get upon it. At his leisure he quietly threw off one,
and then another, until he was satisfied, and slipped off himself to
eat them. As he was feasting on the last the bear came along, and
asked about his good luck. The fox said he would show him how to
get a good supply if he would go with him the next night. So they
went on the ice till they found a hole, and the fox told the bear to
put his tail in this that the fish might bite.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said the fox, “you are very strong, and must wait until a
good many take hold of your tail.” So the bear sat very still for
a time; but when he shifted a little his tail was slightly pulled, for
it was freezing to the ice. “Don’t pull yet,” said the fox; “more
will take hold, and you will have a big haul. You are very strong,
and must catch all you can.” So the bear waited, and the next time
he moved it pulled a little harder. “Not yet,” said the fox; “more
will take hold.” But when the morning was come the fox ran to
a house on the bank, and the dogs began to bark furiously. This
frightened the bear, so that he pulled with all his might, and left
his tail frozen to the ice. Then I came away; but the bears have
had short tails ever since.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. For some reason the bear and the fox fell out, and were going
to fight a duel. The fox chose a cat and a lame dog for his seconds,
while the bear had the wolf and the pig, but the wolf kept away.
The bear and the pig came to the place first, both of them a little
afraid, and the bear said he would climb a tree and watch for the
rest. The pig hid under the leaves by a log. The bear said: “I see
the fox coming. He has two men with him, and one is picking up
stones to throw at us!” For when the dog limped, it seemed to
the bear he was picking up stones. The cat, too, raised its tail and
waved it around. When it did this the bear said: “Now I see the
other man. He has a big club, and oh! how he waves it around!
Lie down there! Keep still! They’ll give it to us if they find us!”
Then he looked again. “Yes, they’re coming! they’re coming!
Keep still! keep still!”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the cat came under the tree, and upon the log. The pig wanted
to see, and tried to peep out; but when the cat saw the leaves moving
she thought it was a mouse. Down she sprang in an instant, and
had the pig by the nose. “Ke-week! ke-we-e-k!” he squealed and
squealed, which scared the cat in turn, and she ran for the tree. The
bear was so frightened when he saw her coming, that he let go his
hold, fell from the tree, and was killed. Then I came away.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this story the narrator imitated the squealing of the pig, etc.,
to the intense delight of the Indian children. It was thus a favorite
tale.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>NOTES ON ONONDAGA DANCES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Onondagas still maintain what Albert Cusick called the Ghost
Dance, but which is the annual Dead Feast, differing from the one
ten days after death. It is managed by the women, and is held in
May or June. The female society, O-kee-weh, makes the appointment
and arranges details. The members of this society are termed O-nah-kee-weh.
The spirits of their dead relatives, especially those who
have died during the year, are supposed to be present throughout
the feast. The living guests assemble from 9 to 10 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, and dance
until sunrise, but have a midnight feast.</p>

<p class='c007'>First of all there is a speech, and then men sing a chant in 3–4
time, accompanied by a large drum and a gourd rattle. The drum
is somewhat like a small churn, with a head stretched across. It
may be made of a keg, but was probably once a kettle, as the name,
<em>ka-na-ju-we</em>, signifies a covered kettle. The first chant begins “Go-yah-ne
na wa-ya-hen,” etc., and one tune follows another with but
a slight variation of the words, which are mostly without meaning,
but <em>wa-ya-hen</em> refers to women. The women stand in a circle before
the singers, keeping time. Then the women sing, and the men are
silent; after which the women march around in a circle to the beat
of the drum. The great Feather Dance follows, the men taking part
in this and some others until midnight, when the feast takes place.
At that time tobacco is burned, and the spirits of the dead are implored
to give the living good and healthy lives through the year.
Dances follow until nearly morning; and among these are the Snake,
Fish, Bear, and Raccoon dances. The Raccoon is similar to the Fish
Dance, but in the former all face around when the time changes. At
the end the leader gives a whoop, and the music ceases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards morning the women again form a circle before the singers,
and nearly the same words and tunes follow as at first. Some
of the words differ, and mean, “The morning has come; we will now
all go home.” Then all the women again march around in the council-house,
and afterwards out and around it slowly. At this time two
men carry the drum while another beats upon it. The women have
something in their hands, and as one or another raises her arms the
men rush around and try to get what she holds. All then return to
the council-house, where a speech is made, and soup is distributed
from the big kettle. Having received their portions, all go home.
While this is an annual feast, it may be given at other times for the
benefit of the sick, being prompted by the spirits of the dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another feast, quite similar, and known as the Night Dance, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>often held at private houses, and is managed by women alone. The
forms of the dance are a little different, and there is no midnight
feast. This is also for the sick, and has similar tunes. It has some
comic features. When the Indian boys hear of a meeting of this
kind, they plan how they may steal “the head.” At intervals the
lights are put out for a few minutes, and then is their chance. One
or more chickens are boiled or roasted, and are known as “the head”
of the feast. Usually a kettle is placed in the middle of the circle of
women, and the chicken is in the soup.</p>

<p class='c007'>Albert Cusick told me his early experiences at two of these feasts,
which will illustrate one prominent feature which I have mentioned.
On one occasion the boys saw that there was no kettle in the circle,
while there was a cluster of women about the pantry door. They
understood the situation, but the door could not be passed. An active
lad quietly made his way through the pantry window, found a pan
with two roast chickens in it, secured some corn bread and other
good things, and got off unobserved. The booty was carried to the
green by the council-house, and eaten with a hearty relish; then the
pan, with the bones, was slipped back into the pantry, and the boys,
according to the old custom, began to caw, like crows. All seemed
safe, however, and the others made fun of them. “You are all frauds.
You haven’t found the head. We have that safe.” So the dances
went on. A speech was made at the close. One head was to go to
the speaker and the other to the singers.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But when they got there the cupboard was bare,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so the poor singers had none.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A dance of this kind was held at the house of my old friend, Mary
Green, one night. Her home was a good-sized log cabin, fairly furnished,
and the feast was well attended. The boys ran around, imitating
hungry crows, but with small chance of getting “the head.”
The circle of women remained unbroken around the stove in the
centre of the room, and on the stove was a big kettle of soup, with
“the head” in the midst of all. The soup was hot, and the kettle
inaccessible. Several tried to crawl through the circle on their hands
and knees, but failed. At last one got through in the dark interval,
burned his fingers indeed, but put the chicken in a pail and successfully
made off. The triumphant crows were soon heard again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The great medicine is made in a society called Ka-noo-tah, of which
I may say more at another time. For ordinary ailments simple remedies
are used, but the Onondagas are easily satisfied when told that
the white man’s remedies may be best for the diseases he has introduced.
When a man is bewitched, that is quite another thing. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Tuscarora once came to Onondaga, who thought he was bewitched,
and Abram Island prescribed for him. He took three tender shoots
each of the waxberry, choke and wild cherry, and the green osier,
and scraped off the bark. This was placed in twelve quarts of hot
water, and almost boiled. This was to be used as an emetic for twelve
days. On the last day Island came again, carrying away what was
last thrown up, but soon returning with a woolly bear caterpillar on
a chip. This he had found in the matter, and it was the witch charm.
It was placed in a paper bag and hung upon the wall. They were told
it would revive and then die again. In a few days there was a rustling
in the paper, and the caterpillar was taken out dead, but looking
as though soaked in water. After so thorough a cleansing the
man got well, of course.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am promised the old Onondaga songs, both music and words,
but my informant that is to be takes his own time. I have said
that these songs are mostly meaningless. Some have been translated
quite poetically, which the Indians assure me have strictly no
meaning, though their associations have almost poetic force, and so
the thought has been given rather than the actual interpretation.
As long as there is time and sound, the singer often cares little what
the words may be, but this is not an invariable rule. I have seen
four kinds of rattles, two of which are antique,—the turtle shell and
gourd. Some are made of cow’s horns, and once only have I seen
a very ingenious one of bark. All are alike effective in dances and
marches.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some curious changes have come over the Onondagas of late.
Heretofore the Green Corn Dance was held about as soon as green
corn was fit for use, but some of the Indians have been giving exhibition
dances at various gatherings, and found there was money in it.
This year they deferred the feast until the autumnal equinox, having
the principal dances on Sunday, September 24, 1893. In this case
those who danced did not pay the piper, but the spectators did. As
many as could be accommodated were admitted to the council-house,
at fifteen cents per head; three dances were given, and then a new
party was admitted. Of course this deprived the feast of all religious
force, and made it a mere show; nor did it quite satisfy those
who saw it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days later the annuity of goods was delivered, a sight not
without interest. So many Oneidas now live with the Onondagas
that a large part of their annuity is distributed at the same time by
the United States agent, Mr. A. W. Ferrin. The cotton cloth for
the Oneidas was placed towards the west end of the council-house,
and Henry Powliss, or Was-theel-go, “Throwing up pins,” checked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>off the Oneida list, while two chiefs measured off the cloth. Jaris
Pierce, or Jah-dah-dieh, “Sailing Whale,” checked the Onondaga list,
assisted in the same way. This lot was placed in the centre of the
house, against the south door. There was some interpreting, and the
scene was quite interesting. The men looked much like any farmers,
but the women were quite picturesque.</p>

<p class='c007'>This mingling of nations is not without many effects. Thus the
Oneida salutation, Sa-go-lah, “How do you do?” has quite taken the
place of the different and longer Onondaga greeting, and other
phrases and words are in common use. The Seneca snow snake,
differing in some respects from the Onondaga, is quite as frequently
seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until recently I had never seen two women pounding corn in one
mortar, but the two pestles rose and fell quite harmoniously. This
may be frequent, for two men seized each his double-headed pestle,
to be photographed on another occasion. The old pestle and mortar
are still quite in favor with most families.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>SCOTTISH MYTHS FROM ONTARIO.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c003'><sup>[4]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In a certain part of Ontario (my stories being true, I must be reticent
as to localities and persons) the country is peopled with Scotch
Highlanders from Glenelg. If, as is often said, Scotch people are
superstitious, the Glenelg men are superlatively so. Every nook and
every grassy plot in that famous glen is haunted, and weird tales belong
to every family, high and low, handed down from father to son.
The Glenelg men in Canada whom I knew still have the traditional
tales,—the ancestral ones, I mean,—and are very willing to tell
them: but I greatly preferred to hear them recount the uncanny
doings of their own Canadian township. They are the third generation
in this country. It is an old part of Ontario,—one of the
oldest, I think, for in a long-discarded burying-ground I found inscriptions
bearing date of the last century. Although so long here,
and tolerably fair farmers, they are curiously backward, preferring
in their daily life to talk Gaelic; and it is even now very common to
find children of eight without a word of English. Most of the very
old people have only their native tongue. Their schools are so poor
that it is difficult to believe one’s self in Ontario, where the standard
of education is so high. They are handsome people,—nearly all very
tall and well-built, bearing a family likeness. The men have none of
the farmer slouch so usual in most country places; they are thorough
Highlanders of the best type, and have the traditional grace and condescension
of manner, even when speaking to an acknowledged superior.
The impression of refinement is intensified by their speech.
They came to this country understanding only Gaelic, had no schools
until the present generation, and therefore received the whole of their
education in church. Their speech is Scripture English, quaint, careful,
and accurate. It was at first an astonishment to me, as my knowledge
of rural life in western Ontario had prepared me to expect from
farmers everywhere the horrible colloquialisms, nasal twang, and most
wonderful idioms which perhaps some Montrealers have noticed in
the townships, for it is the same there, I believe. It was a great
pleasure to me to listen to the polished old English, and I soon recognized
the cause, and was interested, and perhaps startled, to discover
that the beautiful speech of one of the least progressive counties
of Ontario is directly owing to the neglect of the government—in
short, to their want of education.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not long before I discovered with deep, silent delight that
the country-side was peopled with ghosts. It was never hard to give
a turn to the conversation that would result in the recital of something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>weird or horrible, told with the bare simplicity of the doings
of the Witch of Endor, and not doubted in any particular by another
than myself. I remember that this difference between them and me
threatened to disturb my enjoyment. I am always uncomfortable if
“in my company but not of it,” and therefore always agree with
every one unless positively forbidden to do so by a company too
intense for a happy existence. In the present instance, as my infidelity
was unsuspected, I was not hindered from assuming the sentiment
of the hour as a garment which I heartily enjoyed wearing,
and which soon belonged of right to me,—so much so, in fact, that
when the first of the following stories was related in the deepening
dusk in a most ghostly hollow behind a graveyard, it was I who,
when deep-drawn breaths announced the finale, suggested that we
arm ourselves with cudgels and hasten home across the fields. And
we did it, too, no one laughing; it was not an hour for laughter.
We walked in Indian file, following the cow-path, and I think that
I surreptitiously held the coat-tail of the one who strode before me.
And as we walked, we thought that we heard the malevolent and
fatal tap, tap, tapping in the wood across the hollow. But this is
anticipating the dénouement of my tale. Here is the story of—</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE HAUNTED GROVE.</h3>

<p class='c006'>A certain man whom it is safe to call Angus, as there was at least
one Angus in every household, lived near the stage road that connected
two large villages, which were, if I remember aright, about
fourteen miles apart. His home was situated nearly midway between
them, and about a mile from the aforementioned hollow. He seems
to have taken more interest in the post-office than his friends whom
I knew, and subscribed for and studied certain Montreal newspapers.
For this he was pitied in the parish, and called “Poor Angus,” for
the general sentiment of the place was opposed to literature, and
reading was considered a sign of mental weakness. He appears
to have adhered, however, to the habit, whether from native independence
or native imbecility, I cannot say. I have noticed that as
a means of separating a man from his fellows, either strength or
weakness, if sufficiently pronounced, is equally potent. So this man,
following the bent of his nature, went twice or thrice a week to the
post-office late in the afternoon, when the passing stage threw in a
big leather mail-bag. The post-office was in a farmhouse, and to
reach it he walked through the hollow with the unwholesome reputation.
On the slope of the hill farthest from the post-office was a
grove, not a dense wood,—just about half an acre of thinly wooded
land, the trees being so far apart that you could easily get glimpses
and peeps of the country beyond. I remember once admiring a pink
sunset scantily visible among the dark trunks of those trees.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Well, one autumn afternoon Angus was ascending this hill on his
way home with his newspapers, when in the grove on his right suddenly
sounded the chopping of a tree. He stopped, interested at
once. The grove belonged to a neighbor and cousin of his own, and
it had been for very many years left undisturbed. I think it very
possible that it was a “sugar bush,” that is, a wood reserved for
sugar-making, but of this I cannot be sure. But if my guess is right
it would account for the surprise he felt at the cutting down of a
tree there. He went to the fence, or rather stone dike, for that is
one of the very few parts in which you find fields inclosed by stone
dikes in lieu of fences, as in Scotland. The chopping continued,
though he saw no one, and he moved along, expecting every moment
to see man and axe. Finally he shouted. To his intense astonishment
there was no reply, although it was incredible that he was
unheard by a person in so near vicinity. As the echo of his shout
died away, the chopping, which for a moment or two had been suspended,
began again. A curious horror crept over the listener, and
he looked no more, but made haste up the hill, and turning the corner
was soon at home. He said nothing about the matter on this
first occasion, and a few days later was again on the road returning
from the same errand, when, lo! on the quiet air came again the
same chop, chop, chopping. In telling it afterwards, he said that in
his heart he made no fight against fate, but he just thought sadly of
his worldly affairs, and wondered if things were in good shape for
him to leave wife and little ones, for from that hour he confidently
looked for death before another spring. He stood long listening,
and when at last he went home he related the whole circumstance
to his wife. Together they recounted it to friends, who went in parties
and singly to the place, but heard nothing. They also thoroughly
searched the little wood, arguing that chopping must leave
signs behind in the shape of chips and disfigured trunks. But no,
there was no mark of any kind in any part of the grove. Angus was
now earnestly counselled to abandon his literary pursuits. He could
not but own that he had received a warning, and he did own it, but
contended that it was undeserved, and refused to be guided, as one
might say, by a light that, as all admitted, shone with a lurid glare.
He was exhorted to forswear the reading of vain and foolish lies;
for with the acumen which surprised and gratified me so much, they
even refused to regard our newspapers as mediums of information,
recognizing instinctively their right to stand in the ranks of fiction.
Their advice was in all points save one unheeded. With one voice
they bade him, if he heard the warning again, to pursue his way as
if he heard it not, looking neither to the right nor left. This counsel
he followed, and the end shows the folly and uselessness of attempting
to elude a menace which is—well, which is of this kind.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Angus continued to walk to and from the post-office, and when
alone never failed to hear the mysterious axe at work in the wood.
He never heard it unless alone, and it was never heard by any one
else. Although the conviction that his death would happen before
many months took firm hold of his mind, yet in time he became so
accustomed to the thought and its cause as to go about his usual
occupations with much of the wonted interest, and even to hear the
sound of an axe, wielded by invisible hands, without experiencing
agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Weeks sped on and brought winter, and an unusual fall of snow.
The stage-road became blocked, and vehicles left the highway to
make a new track through the fields. For several months that winter
the real road through the hollow was not used, and the snow,
which drifted high in it, covered the dikes on each side. Temporary
roads and footpaths made winding lines over the white plains
on every hand. Angus now followed one of these roads, which ran
parallel to the real highway, just the dike being between them, until
he reached the grove, when he, with extraordinary and fatal hardihood,
instead of remaining in it, used to leave it, and striking out at
right angles to it, would walk through the grove, aiming directly for
his own house, and greatly shortening his walk thereby. The trees
had of course protected the place from wind; there had been no drifting,
and walking was easy. He told it at home, and said with grim
humor that the Man in the Bush seemed pleased that he would come
that way, for his chopping was louder and gladder than ever before;
and his wife repeated her counsel earnestly that he look only straight
before him, and never stop, nor answer any sound, nor take heed in
any way of that unholy work. “And,” said the Angus who years
after related it to me, “the Axe might well be merry when she bade
him that way!” But Angus laid the advice to heart, and strode
steadily through the grove, looking straight before him, and every
day the Axe grew gayer and louder. He did not speak of it now.
He was getting used to it, and the neighbors had ceased to think
of it, the more easily because, as I have told, his literary tastes had
separated this Angus from among them. So one day the owner of
the grove and his sons went over to chop down one particular tree
that, on the day when they had searched the grove in the autumn,
had appeared to them to merit destruction. Perhaps it was a beech
growing among maples, where it was not wanted, or perhaps it was
a dead maple cumbering the ground. They began to chop. It was
late in the afternoon. One said with a laugh, “It may be we are
taking the tree that poor Angus’ ghost has been working at so long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the invisible man heard them. At any rate he did not
chop that evening. It was only his cousin’s axe that gave the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>strokes that poor Angus heard as he turned from the track to cross
the grove as usual. The tree was swaying and shivering, and all but
ready to fall. He had cut trees all his life, and he knew the sound
of the stroke when the task was almost done; but no goblin’s trick
would beguile him into turning his head. He looked neither to right
nor left. Then the chopping ceased, and his blood nearly froze as he
heard his own name shouted in tones of such horror that a familiar
voice was unrecognized. Others caught up the cry. There was a
din, the crashing of branches and sound of rushing feet, mingled
with shouts of warning, and poor Angus fell, with the enormous tree
upon him. When at last the burden was removed, and the crushed
body borne home, there were men there who heard among the trees
inhuman laughter, and knew that Something had lured poor Angus
to his doom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another weird tale, that made a strong impression on me, I wrote
down at the time, and called—</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE FATED FAGOT.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The title seemed very effective then, though now it strikes me as
more alliterative than true, as it concerns a single stick and not a
fagot at all. It was a round stick about five feet long, probably the
trunk of a young ash tree brought home from the woods to serve
some purpose as a pole. It lay forgotten in the back yard of a farmhouse
close to a little village called L——. It was a fine strong pole
about twice as thick as a man’s wrist. The sun seasoned it day by
day, so that it soon was no longer “green” wood, but wood that
would have crackled well in the fire. But for whatever purpose it
had been brought home, it seemed oddly forgotten. No use was
made of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day one of the young men of the family went to the “bush,”
spent an hour there, and returned with just such another long, straight
sapling. He dragged it into the yard, and his eye fell on the first
one. “There,” said he, “I’ve had little to do spending my time seeking
a pole, and this one ready to my hand all the while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aye,” said Mary his sister, standing in the doorway, “that is what
I’m telling them. Since that pole was brought, father has taken a
bar from the gateway, and Neil has cut down a young tree in the pasture,
and you’ve been seeking in the bush, all of you wanting this
same pole that’s only lying in the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps there’ll be something the matter with it, Mary,” her
brother answered, ever ready to suspect black art; “any way, it is
dry now, and I’ll chop it for you, and it will soon be out of harm’s
way.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>And Mary, bidding him do it at once,—for she was then wanting
some firewood,—turned into the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man went, whistling, for his axe, and the pole would
have been in half a dozen pieces in a few moments had not a neighbor
hailed him from the road. Throwing down the axe, he went to
the fence to speak with him, calling meantime to a little brother to
gather sticks and chips for Mary. So Mary, or rather <em>Maari</em>, for
they always pronounced the familiar name just as it is spelled in
some of William Black’s Scotch novels, cooked the midday meal,
but not with the elusive pole of which she had intended to make a
speedy end. But she did not forget it; on the contrary, it seemed
to prey on her mind. As if fascinated, she would go out and look at
it. She dragged it into the woodshed, that its destiny might seem
more sure. She recommended it to the men of the family as being
small and suited to the stove, but still it remained uncut. Sometimes
they said that they could not find it, at other times it was forgotten.
If just about to cut it, they were sure to be interrupted.
Mary took the axe herself to chop it, one day, but a brother laughingly
took it from her and sent her back to the house, promising to
follow with an armful of sticks in a few minutes; but he failed to
keep his word, for a young colt broke loose and needed his immediate
attention to prevent its reaching the highway!</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning a wagon drove up with a family party from a distance,
come to spend the day. Mary welcomed them, and the little
house was all bustle and noise while the visitors were being made
comfortable. A dinner fit for the occasion must be prepared, and
Mary sent her brother in haste to the woodshed that the oven might
be heated at once. He came back with an armful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would have cut the stick that vexes you so much, Maari,” he
said, “but it seems gone at last out of our way. Some one has cut
it before me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” replied the girl, “here it is.” And as she spoke a weight
seemed to fall on her spirits, for she did not smile again, but moved
amongst her guests preoccupied and still. The pole was lying close
to the kitchen door, along the path leading from the woodshed. The
young man thinking it in the way and apt to make people stumble,
took it to the shed and threw it in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dinner was over, and all the news discussed, and it was the middle
of the afternoon when Mary was observed by some one of the
family to be standing in the kitchen doorway alone. I think it was
her mother who, wondering at her staying there so long, went to
her. She was shivering violently, although it was pleasant weather,
and she pointed her finger, without speaking, to the pole, which lay
at her feet in the pathway again. One of the boys was told to go at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>once and chop it in pieces, and Mary was kindly chided for her foolish
terror. The visitors began to bestir themselves, for they had a
lonely drive before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will leave the cutting of the stick until they are on the road,”
said Mary’s brother; and he went to get out their horses and “speed
the parting guests.” Farewells were said in hearty fashion at the
gate, and then the family hastened to take up their interrupted tasks,
separating, some to one thing and some to another; and yet again
the stick was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening meal was late, and Mary was hurried. A little daughter
of one of the neighbors, who was in, bustled about, helping. She
flew in and out with chips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall I drag this pole out of the way, Maari?” asked the child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said Mary; “<em>it is too late</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And there at the kitchen door it remained, and Mary was pale and
silent, her thoughts being otherwhere. That night they were roused
from sleep by her cry for help, and when they went to her they found
her sick unto death. A doctor was fetched in haste; it was cholera
morbus, and hopeless, as he knew at once, and before the sun rose
Mary was dead. The stick lay at the door, and one of the kindly
neighbors, who were doing what was needful during the following
days, lifted it and sawed it carefully in two to serve as rests for the
coffin, by means of which the bearers could convey it to the grave;
and thus the fated stick fulfilled its mission.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another tale floats in my memory, enfolding the unwonted image
of a—</p>

<h3 class='c005'>BLUE BUTTERFLY,</h3>

<p class='c009'>which measured nearly four inches across the extended wings. The
color and size suggest a moth rather than a butterfly, do they not?
Whatever it was, it was sufficiently rare to attract a great deal of
notice, but not of the scientific sort. An unknown object was sure
to be regarded with suspicion; and this butterfly fluttered one July
over a certain farm, secure from ill because of the awe with which it
was regarded. It was constantly watched, and cautiously pursued.
Its most innocent actions became weighty, and were subject to much
misconstruction. Some one discovered by gruesome experience that
the glance of its minute eye could convey a shudder. Its friendliness
was suspected. Well, by an unfortunate coincidence, at this
very time the churning of butter on this farm was not attended with
success. This fact impressed my friends more than it did me, for I
reflected grimly that their butter very generally was not a brilliant
issue. This had resulted in my eating honey very extensively during
my visits to them. However, I repressed any unkind thoughts on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the subject, and assisted with much pleasure in the discussion regarding
the doings of the butterfly. It is, moreover, probable that
what they complained of was not bad butter, but cream that would
not be butter at all. This state of things had begun with the advent
of the butterfly and continued in spite of everything done to counteract
the evil influence too evidently at work. The community was
aroused—<em>all but one person</em>. A certain woman who lived alone and
refused to know her neighbors evinced no interest in our investigations.
She knew of them, and sneered weird Gaelic sneers, which
were translated to me, and at which I shook my head according to
custom. This woman did not go to church, which was an extreme
of wickedness all but unknown there. I do not know if she were
insane or only original, but she was certainly at war with the sentiments
of the community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Well, for three weeks she scoffed, the butterfly fluttered, the butter
“did not come,” and we ventilated the subject, which naturally
increased in interest and bulk. At the end of those three weeks
one man set his teeth firmly, armed himself with a wet towel, and
sallied out to meet the mysterious insect single-handed. This man
was directly interested in the sale of the butter. He met the foe
only a few yards from the house, and got the better of it at once by
one fell blow. All gathered round to see it. I did not see it, and I
never saw it living either. From description it was a beautiful specimen.
When I heard of its death I was angry. I had not intended
serious consequences to any of the actors in this idyl, and was indignant
for an hour. At the end of that time I was startled to hear that
the poor lonely woman had been found dead. Her body was discovered
on the ground near her own door. It was seen by passers-by
not twenty minutes after the butterfly’s destruction, and her life had
not been extinct much more than a quarter of an hour. Comment
is needless, as was felt at the time, little being said, but much conveyed
by nods and shaking of heads. As if to complete the chain of
evidence, next day the butter came!</p>

<p class='c004'>The particular characteristic of these tales appears to me to be
their picturesqueness. They are more dramatic than “shop” ghost
stories usually are, and the situations and accessories are romantic.
I have some other stories of the superstitious kind gathered among
a totally different “folk,” and with two exceptions they have not
seemed to me worth remembering. The two I except are interesting
only by reason of the difficulty of arriving at any rational theory in
explanation of them. They have no prettiness nor romance about
them; they are simply <em>creepy</em>. But this is a digression, as I am not
going to tell them now. I will just remark before returning to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Glenelg friends, that in one of these two <em>difficult</em> tales of mine I was
myself an active participator in the plot, and conversed at length
with the ghost,—quite calmly, too, for I thought all the time that
he was in the flesh. It is something to mourn over, that such an
opportunity should present itself and be neglected,—an opportunity
to “catch a ghost, and tame it, and teach it to do tricks,” and realize
fabulous proceeds!</p>

<p class='c007'>Well, to return. The lore of my Scotch friends was like themselves.
I admired them very much. Sometimes certain persons and
circumstances surround us when we are uplifted in soul, and we see
them bathed in light, glorified, as it were, by roseate hues of our
own conjuring. Knowing this, I was often afraid that I created the
transforming light in which they appeared to me to move. It used,
therefore, to give me great happiness when something would happen
that proved the charm to be objective; as, for instance, when one of
these unlettered men unconsciously reëchoed a sentiment from the
mysterious thinker whom we call Thomas à Kempis, and almost in
the same words enunciated the truth that of the mysteries of the
supernatural “no one can with safety speak who would not rather
be silent.” And they were silent, and profoundly reverent. These
pretty goblin tales lack the element of “research,” and are not profane;
they are only fantasies.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have yet another to tell, and the telling of it gives me a sense
of guilt, for it was given to me by stealth, having assumed such
proportions that the recounting it was denounced publicly in church,
the denunciation being accompanied by threat of excommunication.
It is much the same as the Butterfly tale, and bears a striking resemblance
to certain German wehr-wolf legends. It is not about a wolf,
however, the chief actor being—</p>

<h3 class='c005'>A BLACK DOG.</h3>

<p class='c006'>One harvest time, forty or fifty years ago (or perhaps more), in a
certain farmhouse not a mile from the grove where poor Angus met
with sudden death, very strange things were observed. Pails left at
night in trim rows on benches ready for the morning milking would
be found, when required, on the barn floor, or on top of a hay-rick,
or in some other equally unsuitable situation. A spade might be
searched for in vain until some member of the family, climbing into
bed at night, would find it snugly reposing there before him. Pillows
were mysteriously removed, and found sometimes outdoors at
a distance from the house. Screws were removed from their places,
and harness hung up in the stable was taken apart. The family were
rendered materially uncomfortable, and did their best to become also
immaterially miserable by searching for proofs of supernatural agency.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>A great deal of proof was forthcoming; the matter was soon beyond
doubt, and nothing else was talked about than the condition of things
on this farm. Many speculations were afloat; every tiny occurrence
was examined as possibly affording evidence in the matter. When a
large black dog, evidently without owners, was observed to frequent
the vicinity, the eye of the populace was at once upon it. It was shy,
hiding and skulking about a good deal, and it was always hard to discover
when sought. The owner of the land was strongly advised to
shoot it, and the popular distrust was increased when he did one day
fire at it without producing any visible results, the dog being seen a
few hours later in excellent health. The interest excited was so great
that when a “bee” was held on this farm for something connected
with the harvest the attendance was immense, quite unusually so,
and the neighbor women came in to help in the preparation of supper
on an extensive scale. Some of the men made a long table of
boards to accommodate the company. The women spread cloths and
arranged dishes and viands. When all was ready, they regarded it
with approval, pleased especially with the shining of the long rows
of plates and the whiteness of the linen: then some of them took the
dinner-horn and went out to give the signal to the men, who were
at some distance away. The other women went to the cook-house,
where in summer the kitchen stove stood, and the supper table was
left alone. A few minutes later, when all gathered around it again,
chaos reigned where order had been. The cloth was spotted with
symmetrical shapes, a tiny heap of dust and sand was on every plate,
and the knives were on the floor. The disorder was of a strangely
methodical kind, the same quantity of dust being on every plate,
while each knife was placed in the same position as his fellows. The
men trooped in whilst the women were staring aghast, and great was
their indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me your gun,” cried one, “and I’ll put in this silver bit with
the charge, and see if it will not make an end of such work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And just then the dog was seen prowling about at the foot of the
yard near a thicket of bushes where he probably was often concealed.
The gun was fired; it carried a silver bullet, and this time the aim
was true, for all saw that the animal was shot. The day had been
warm, and they were tired out, and did not go to make sure of results
at once. They sat around the rearranged board for an hour or
more before some of them sauntered down to see the vanquished
enemy. They did not wonder at first to find no trace of a dog, as,
like any other wounded animal, it was likely to creep into the thicket
to die. But the thicket was small, and was soon explored on hands
and knees. Nothing was there; and the body of that dog was never
seen by mortal, although the search grew hourly more diligent and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>thorough. And whilst they searched, there came a boy running from
a stone house not far distant, bidding them to come over with him
quickly, for grandfather was dead. “He dragged himself into the
house,” said the child, “as though he were hurt, an hour ago, and
lay down on his bed, and now he is dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Friends hastened over, but were met at the door by the dead man’s
wife, terrified and weeping, but almost forbidding them to enter. For
some unfortunate reason, the poor woman would not let them near
the body, little knowing, I suppose, the suspicion in their minds and
the construction which must inevitably be put on her demeanor.</p>

<p class='c004'>This story concerns a man who is, I should think, grandfather and
great-grandfather to a fifth of the population of that township, and
it assumed such proportions that, as I have stated, mention of it was
prohibited, long years afterwards, by a clergyman now living in the
county of Bruce. It is to this day a little difficult for the descendants
of the man who died that long-ago harvest-time to marry out of their
own connection. If one of them should ever aspire to represent his
county in parliament, the enemy will assuredly come to the front
with the Black Dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, I have told such of the weird stories of that county as I best
remember. I heard many more, but they are wholly or partially
forgotten; fragments of them I retain. One is especially to be regretted
because it was what is called well authenticated, having been
noised abroad sufficiently to be noticed by some newspaper, which
naturally produced an inquiry. It was considered in that region to
be <em>the</em> ghost story <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</span></i>. I was tempted to try and relate
it at length in this paper, but found that I could not do so without
supplying from fancy what would take the place of forgotten details.
It is a story of a desecrated grave. I was shown the grave. The
body of a young girl was stolen from it the night after burial, taken
to a neighboring village and concealed in a tavern stable, the intention
being to convey it next day to Montreal; but that very night
the girl herself appeared in a dream to her father, telling him where
her body then lay, naming the guilty parties, and giving a perfectly
accurate account of the robbery, describing the road taken through
fields, and a discussion that actually had taken place regarding the
advisability of taking the coffin, that is, the possibility of such theft
making prosecution easier in the event of discovery. The father
roused friends, who accompanied him to the village, and the body
was discovered in exactly the position described in his dream and
recounted by him on their way thither.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although I do not, in this or any such story, accept the supernatural
theory, I cannot explain it. It has never been explained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>It belongs to a country peopled with unearthly shapes, the offspring
of poetic natures, wholly uninformed, and possibly the conditions
are favorable to “manifestations.” “He who desires illusions,” you
know, “shall have them beyond his desire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I am reluctant to leave the subject, there is so much to tell, for
the writing of this paper has revived incidents that seemed quite
forgotten. I would like to talk about a certain lonely carpenter
shop, in which, before a death, the sound of plane and hammer used
to be heard at night, and we were compelled to believe that the ghost
of the sick one was, with officious if not indecent haste, making his
coffin. As he was not yet a ghost, that is, not yet disembodied, there
was a confusion of thought here. On some occasions he added to the
nuisance by burning a candle which extinguished of its own accord
if approached.</p>

<p class='c007'>A personage whom they called the Evil One was not infrequently
encountered by individuals in lonely places. I was accustomed to
hearing of these meetings, and therefore was much surprised at the
indignation shown against a certain young fellow of a frivolous disposition,
who claimed to have had such an experience. I inquired
of a clergyman, who knew the locality well, the reason of the young
man’s narrative being received with disfavor. He laughed very heartily
while he explained that a visit from the Prince of Darkness was
regarded as proof of the highest sanctity, and was therefore the privilege
only of persons aged and of long-established preëminence in the
church. The young man was disturbing the traditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was a little shocked to hear of a repulsive superstition which I
have read of as being peculiar to certain parts of England,—I mean
a horrible vampire story given in explanation of the ravages often
made in a family by consumption. I did not meet this superstition
myself, but was told that it was among them. Consumption was rife
among them; it seemed to be hereditary. They looked so remarkably
robust, and yet fell so easily a prey to this disease, and it seldom
lingered! It was nearly always a very rapid illness. These are
sad memories. The matter always seemed so hopeless! In a sickroom
superstition ceases to be either funny or graceful. I stood by
sick-beds with a sore heart, knowing too well that the haste with
which a doctor was procured would be fully equalled by the zeal
with which his orders would be disregarded. They had faith in the
physician, the man, but none whatever in his prescriptions. There
were two doctors, whom I may call Dr. X. and Dr. Z. Each had his
admirers, who vaunted his superiority.</p>

<p class='c007'>I stopped one day on the road to inquire, of a man whom I met,
after the health of some of his neighbors.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Oh,” said he, “they would soon be well if they would see Dr. Z.
They’ll be having Dr. X. all the time, and I do not see that they’re
gaining at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I said something in defence of Dr. X.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Miss F., I’ll just tell a story that will let you know the
difference between these two doctors,” said my friend. “My father
was once laid up very bad with a cold that he could not get rid of,
and we sent for Dr. X., who gave him a phial of medicine. Well,
next day our neighbor, John McM., came in, and seeing my father
no better, he said, ‘Oh, you should have had Dr. Z.; but I’ll soon
put that right for you.’ Straightway he went back to his own house
for a bottle that had been a year or two there, of Dr. Z.’s mixing. It
had been in the house since his father died, but they were not sure
that it had been some of his medicines. They had forgotten all about
it, and the paper of writing had come off; so they did not know how
much to take, but they just took the writing on Dr. X.’s bottle for a
guide, and poured out a spoonful for my father, who began to mend
at once, and was out at work in three or four days after.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This tale moved me so much that I went to the side of the road
and sat down on a log to thoroughly take it in and fix it in my
memory. When I believed that I had it safely, I asked gently,
“Murdoch, what if it had been a liniment and poisonous?”</p>

<p class='c007'>My friend drew himself up, his face aglow with faith in Dr. Z., and
replied proudly, “Dr. Z. never gives poisons; he always gives healthy
medicines.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But I am going from one story to another, and lengthening my
“uncanny folk-lore” unwarrantably. To repeat myself, it is hard to
leave these reminiscences.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>But before closing I would like to say to those who speak of <em>authentic</em>
ghost stories, that nothing will make one so thoroughly sceptical
regarding them as entering into them heartily, and, so to say, assisting
in their composition. I used to wish them true with all my heart.
I earnestly desired to believe them, for I was lonely, and this supplied
excitement; but being behind the scenes, I was unable to shut
my eyes to their origin. On one occasion, when a man was relating
to me a peculiarly attractive narrative, I perceived in it a flaw, or a
lack of sequence which would be a weak place in his chain of evidence.
I made a remark, a <em>sideways</em> remark, which I meant to serve
as suggestion without showing that I saw the fault. I saw the idea
take. He was excited, and did not realize that I had drawn his attention
to the weak place, which he immediately bridged over, materially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>changing the story in doing so. He was an honorable man,
who would have scorned a deliberate falsehood; but scarcely an hour
later I heard him retail the altered narrative and offer to give every
detail on oath as perfectly accurate. He knew that I heard him, and
in fact he appealed to me as having been the first hearer. He was
entirely unconscious that I had assisted him to manufacture the most
valuable part of the evidence. I did not confess. I think it wrong
to spoil a good story. But I am quite certain that ghost-seers, even
if they are mighty men who edit reviews, are not, and cannot be,
reliable witnesses.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>AN OTOE AND AN OMAHA TALE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The tales which follow were obtained in Nebraska, from an informant
of Otoe extraction, married to an Omaha, and are given as
nearly as possible in the words of the narrator.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE CHIEF’S DAUGHTERS: AN OTOE TALE.</h3>

<p class='c006'>In the evening, in summer, upon a hot night two young girls,
chief’s daughters, lay on the ground outside their tents gazing at the
sky. As the stars came out one of them said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish I were away up there. Do you see where that dim star
is? There is where I wish I might be.” And she fixed her eyes upon
the twinkling star that seemed to be vanishing behind the clouds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other girl said: “It is too dim. I wish I were up by that
bright one, that large brilliant star,” and she pointed to where a
steady light glowed red.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon they were asleep and the brilliant lights in the blue above
kept watch. In the night when they awoke each young girl found
herself where she had wished to be. The one in the dim star was in
the home of a brave young chief, and she became his bride and was
happy. The beautiful star had appeared dim to her while she was
yet upon the earth because it was so far, far away that she could not
see its glorious light.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl in the bright star found herself in a servant’s home, and
was obliged to do all manner of work and to become the servant’s
wife. This star had been nearer the earth, and so it had seemed to
be the larger and brighter star. When this girl found that her
friend had gone to a beautiful star and become the wife of a chief,
with plenty of servants to wait upon her, and that she was never
permitted to do any work, she cried and cried because the change in
her own condition seemed more cruel, and she was even obliged to
live with a servant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girls were still friends and often met in the clouds and went
out to gather wild turnips, but the chief’s wife could never dig, her
friend was always obliged to serve her. Whenever they started out
an old man would say to them:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you dig a turnip, you must strike with the hoe once, then
pull up the turnip. Never, by any means, strike twice.” After going
to gather turnips many times and receiving always this same instruction
the chief’s wife grew curious, and one day she said to her friend:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why is it, they tell us to strike but once? To-day when you
dig that turnip I wish you to strike twice. Let us see why they
allow us to strike but once.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>The servant struck once with the hoe and took up the turnip, then,
as commanded, she struck with her hoe again in the same place.
Behold a hole! She leaned forward and looked down. She saw
her home. She cried to her friend. “Look! I can see through
the clouds. See! there is our home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief’s wife looked also, and she saw the village and her home.
The girls sat looking through the hole, and they longed to go home,
and they sat weeping. An old man chanced to pass by, and he saw
them and stopped and asked:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter? What are you crying about?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And they answered, “Because we can see our home. We are so
far away, we wish to be there, but we can never get there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man passed on. He went to the chief and he told him
that the girls sat weeping because they could see their home, and
they wanted to go back to the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief then called all his people together, and he sent them
away to find all the lariats<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c003'><sup>[5]</sup></a> that they could.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the village, on the earth, every one had mourned for the chief’s
daughters, who had so strangely disappeared, and could not be
found. It was a long time since they were lost; but the people still
thought of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>To-day in the village a great many people had come to see the
boys and young men play. They used a ring<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c003'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and a long stick,
round at one end. One person would throw the ring in the air and
at the same time another would try to send his arrow through it;
the men would run swiftly and throw their sticks when they were
near the ring, for the one who got most arrows through while the
ring was still in the air was the winner. All the people were excited
over the game and urging on the young men, when one of them
happened to look up toward the sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, look up,” he called out, “something is coming down. Look!
They are very large. Look at them!”</p>

<p class='c007'>All who heard stopped and looked up, and others seeing them
look, turned to see what it was. Many ran to the spot where these
things were falling. Then the people found they were the lost
girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The good chief in the dim star had ordered all the lariats knotted
together and then he had wound them around the bodies of the two
girls and dropped them gently through the hole in the sky to the
earth, keeping tight the end of the rope until the girls reached the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joyfully the Indians ran before the girls to carry the news of their
return to their sorrowful parents. One of the girls looked sad and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>pitiful, the other looked happy as though she had been in some beautiful
place.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>STORY OF THE SKULL: AN OMAHA STORY.</h3>

<p class='c006'>A woman was walking along, she was proud because she had on
her finest clothes, and she met another woman, who asked:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going, sister-in-law?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going off a long ways.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us go together, then,” said the second woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>They walked on, and met a third woman, who asked:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going?” and when they answered her she said:
“I am going also; let us go together;” and they walked along one
after the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>They met a fourth woman, who asked: “Where are you going,
sister-in-law?” and she also joined them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walking in single file, the women came to a pile of bones where
people had died.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first woman kicked them with her foot, and, turning to the
second woman, said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“These belong to you. Carry them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The second woman kicked the bones with her foot and said contemptuously
to the third woman:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“These are the bones of your relatives. Carry them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The third woman kicked them with her foot, and, turning to the
fourth woman, said: “These bones belong to you. Carry them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the fourth woman answered: “This is the skull of my sister-in-law.
You should not be disrespectful. I will carry it along so
that you shall respect it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The women wore a skin belted in at the waist, making a skirt of
one part, and leaving the other long enough to cover the back and
to draw over the head, and the last woman put it between her back
and the blanket, saying: “I shall carry it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But after a time she wearied of carrying it, and she put it down
by the roadside in a place where no one would molest it. But the
skull followed them, singing:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“There were four women passing along here. One of them is my
sister-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The women heard it singing, and ran. When they camped for the
night the skull came up and destroyed the first woman. It bit her
and she died.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the three women awoke and found one dead, they fled from
the skull, but it followed, singing:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“There were four women passing along here. One of them is my
sister-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>They ran away from it and camped for the night, but when they
awoke in the morning they found another woman had been killed by
the skull, so again they fled, but again they heard it singing:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“There were four women passing along here. One of them is my
sister-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning only one woman awoke, and the skull came up to
her and said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sister-in-law, carry me again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She dared not refuse, and after they had gone a short distance the
skull said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look among the trees until you find one where the raccoons
have their nest. Then if you are hungry you shall have something
to eat. Look for a certain tree, find the hollow place where the
raccoon goes in to its nest and drop me in after it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman did as she was told and she dropped the skull in. It
somehow killed the raccoon. After it had got to the bottom of the
tree it called:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cut a hole in this tree and let me out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman cut the hole; first she took the raccoon out from the
tree, and then she took the skull out. She cooked the raccoon, then
she took the stomach of the raccoon for a bag, and melted down the
raccoon fat, put it in the stomach bag and sewed it up. She hid it
from the skull; she had a purpose in doing this, and the skull did not
know that she had done it, and she carried the bag with her. They
stopped twice more during their journey; each time the woman did
as the skull directed, and each time she made the bag and filled it
and sewed it up, and the skull did not see her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fourth time the woman hunted for a very large tree, and when
she had found it she dropped the skull into the hole and then ran
off by herself. The skull called: “I have killed the raccoon. Now
let me out.” No answer. Then the skull knew the woman had left,
and said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wherever you go I shall find you and have my revenge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It commenced to gnaw a place in the tree to let itself out, and it
took it a day and a half to make a hole large enough to get through.
When it came out, it went along, saying:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wherever you go I shall find you and have my revenge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by the woman heard the skull saying that, and she took
the bag of raccoon grease and threw it at the skull; it went all over
it, and it could not go on, and while it stopped to clean itself the
woman ran on ahead.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the skull caught up to her, and she heard it say:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wherever you go I shall find you and have my revenge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the woman stopped and threw another bag at the skull, and
it had to stop and clean itself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The third time it caught up to her, and she threw another bag of
grease at it. But the fourth time the woman went on till she came
to a woods, but the skull could not reach the woods until the next
morning for it had to cross a creek, and so it went back on the side
of the hill and had to roll down and so cross the creek. The woman
found an old man in the forest making bows and arrows, and she
asked him to protect her from the skull, but he paid no attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother, help me! Protect me!” But he took no notice of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle, protect me!” He paid no attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father, protect me from the skull!” He did not notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grandfather,” she called, “Help me! Protect me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is the relationship,” he said. He was an immense man,
and his long hair was done up in a big knot on the back of his head.
He told her to untie it and get in there, so she did so. And he told
her to sit there and wait until he was ready. After a while he went
on making bows and arrows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently the skull came up and went round and round the old
man, saying:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Old man give me my woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the old man was silent. Then, said the skull:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me the woman I was running after.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the old man would not answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the skull asked for the woman the fourth time, the old man
said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am tired of you.” So he took a bow and broke the skull in
pieces, and he said to the woman:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get down and gather up these pieces. Pile them up, and set
them on fire. After you set them on fire, whatever you see, don’t
you touch it. You will be punished if you do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the woman saw the fire going down she espied a comb.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c003'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
She picked it up and hid it in her blanket, but it burned her side so
badly that she died. The old man said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told you not to pick up anything, but you did so. I punish you.
Disobedience brings its own punishment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that all?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When Carey told it to me, he said the old man hit the skull and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>it went into the air; when it came down it turned into knives, forks,
thimbles, threads, awls, wax, needles, and scissors. The man told
the woman to come down from his hair but not to pick up anything
that was on the ground; if she did he would punish her. And the
old man went off and sat down under a tree. She tried to pick up a
pair of scissors; when she did so her hands dropped off. That is
the way Carey told it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Carey did not get it right. This is a very old story, and at the
time it was first told we never knew of such things as knives, forks,
awls, or scissors. Carey has added that, or some of the younger
people have told it that way because they now use these things. But
I have told it to you the old way, and that is the right way.”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>EXHIBIT OF GAMES IN THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Primitive Religions, and Folk-lore, including Games, are the
subject of a special section in the Anthropological Building at the
Columbian Exposition. This section, which is known as the “Section
of Religions, Games, and Folk-lore,” is located upon the main
floor, where the exhibit occupies a series of cases on the south
side and a line of flat cases which extend across the entire building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Folk-lore is the name given to the material which has come down
to us in the sayings and customs of mankind. Its study, for which
no special name has been devised, is an important branch of the science
of anthropology.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief object of the collection is to show things which illustrate
folk traditions and customs. The field being a vast one, the collection
has been practically restricted to the subject of games.
The basis of the collection was formed in the Museum of Archaeology
of the University of Pennsylvania during the past two years. The
University’s collection has been supplemented by exhibits from individuals
and the leading manufacturers of games in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The objects are classified and arranged for comparative study,
games of the same general sort being placed together. They are
contained in twelve table cases running from the southernmost entrance
on the west side to the corresponding entrance on the east
side. Puzzles and the simple games of children commence the
series.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE I.<br /> PUZZLES, CHILDREN’S GAMES, MANCALA.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The ingenious objects which we designate as “puzzles” are represented
by about one hundred and twenty-five specimens exhibited
by the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. They begin
with a collection of East Indian puzzles “invented” by Aziz Hussan
of Saharanpore, among which may be seen many types of puzzles
that are common in Europe and America. The Chinese puzzles of
wood, bone, and ivory follow them. Chinese puzzles, long a household
word, are very limited in number. Those which are made for
export are invariable in form, and consist of the familiar “Ring
Puzzle,” the “Geometrical Puzzle,” and the “Dissected Cube.”
Their Chinese names are all descriptive, and the “Ring Puzzle,”
which they call “The Nine Interlinked Rings,” was probably borrowed
by Chinese from India. The number of types in the entire
series of puzzles is surprisingly small. The one that was revived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>some years since under the name of the “Fifteen Puzzle,” and which
was described by an English writer some two hundred years ago,
has suggested a large group. “Pigs in Clover,” an American invention,
is the most recent addition to the world’s amusements of
this character, and its wide diffusion and popularity is shown here in
a great variety of specimens from different countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the simpler amusements of children are suggested by the
objects on the north side of this case. Here are to be seen Mr.
William Wells Newell’s “Games and Songs of American Children,”
and “The Counting-out Rhymes of Children,” by Dr. H. Carrington
Bolton, two books which may be regarded as classical in their particular
field. Mr. Pak Yong Kiu, of the Corean Commission to the
Columbian Exposition, has furnished the following interesting addition
to the collection of children’s counting-out rhymes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hau al ta</div>
      <div class='line'>Tu al da</div>
      <div class='line'>Som a chun</div>
      <div class='line'>Na al da,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yuk nong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ku chi,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pol ta,</div>
      <div class='line'>Chong kun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ko tu ra,</div>
      <div class='line'>Biong.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wide diffusion of the custom of using counting-out rhymes
among children, and the general resemblance they bear to each other,
present problems of curious interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the imitative games of children, there are few more interesting
than the Toros or mock bull-fight of Spanish boys. A
wicker mask from Madrid, representing the bull’s head, which is used
in this sport, is suspended beside this case, within which may be
seen the toy <i><span lang="osp" xml:lang="osp">espadas</span></i> or swords and the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">banderillios</span></i>. Tops are shown
to be of great antiquity and of very general use over the earth.
Their age is illustrated by a wooden top from the Fayum, Egypt,
discovered by Mr. Flinders Petrie at Kahûn, belonging to 2800 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>
They were common among the American Indians, north and south.
A number of balls of baked clay and stone, which were whipped in
a game on the ice, represent the primitive tops of the Sioux, while a
more recent Sioux top of wood with a peg of brass shows foreign
influences. Among the Omahas tops were called <em>Moo de de ska</em>, a
name which Mr. Francis La Flesche says is not descriptive. The
explorations conducted for the Department by Mr. George A. Dorsey
in Peru have contributed several interesting specimens to this
collection. Two prehistoric tops from Ancon are identical in form
with the ancient Egyptian top, while another from an ancient grave
at Arica is distinguished by a spindle, not unlike the modern tops of
Japan. The use of pop-guns among the ancient Peruvians is also
shown by two beautifully carved specimens of wood contained in a
llama skin pouch, from an ancient grave in Cañete valley. Popguns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>were used by many if not all of the American Indian tribes.
Among the Omahas the children made them of willow branches, and
then, by partly stopping one end, would convert them into squirt-guns.
The toy squirt-gun sold in the Chicago shops is here shown
beside the syringe from India used in the Hindu <em>Holi</em> Festival.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jackstraws, which are known in England as “Spillikins” and in
France as <em>Les Jonchets</em>, are next in order. The peculiar Chinese
name appended to the Chinese specimens, “Eight Precious Things,”
suggests the probability that China was the country from which we
derived them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of this case is devoted to the implements for a
game that holds an unique position among the world’s games, and
for which no place could be found in the series that follow. It is
variously played with pebbles, shells, and seeds in holes dug in the
ground, or upon a board with cup-like depressions. The game appears
to be found wherever Arab influence has penetrated. It is
very generally played in Africa, in Asia Minor, and in India. Two
boards are exhibited, one brought from Jerusalem for the University
Museum by Mrs. John Harrison of Philadelphia, and another from
the Gaboon River in Africa. The Syrians in the Damascus house
in the Turkish village in the Midway Plaisance know it under the
name of <em>Mancala</em>, and it is a favorite game with the Chief of the
Dahomey village, who frequently plays it with his son before his hut
in the Plaisance. Among the so-called Dahomeyans this game is
called <em>Madaji</em>, the board <em>adjito</em>, and the seeds which they use, <em>adji</em>.
It is a game for two persons. As played in Syria, there are several
forms of the game. One is called <em>lâ’b madjnuni</em>, or the “Crazy Game.”
Ninety-eight cowrie shells are used, which are distributed unequally
in the fourteen holes in the board, which is placed transversely
between the two players. The first player takes all the pieces
from the hole at the right of his row and drops them, one at a time,
in the first hole on the opposite side, and so on, continuing around
the board until the last one is let fall. He thereupon takes all the
pieces from that hole and distributes them one by one as before,
until, arriving at the last piece, he takes all the pieces again in his
hands. This is continued until the last piece dropped either falls
into an empty hole or completes two or four in the hole in which it
falls. In the latter case the player takes the two or four for his own,
as well as the contents of the hole opposite, and should there be two
or four in the next hole or holes to the one at which he stopped, he
also takes them with those opposite. The players continue in turn,
and when the game is finished the one gaining the highest number
of cowries wins. If a player’s last piece falls in an empty hole, his
turn is ended. Skill is of no avail in this form of the game, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>result always being a mathematical certainty, accordingly as the
cowries are distributed at the beginning.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE II.<br /> BALLS, QUOITS, MARBLES.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The antiquity of the ball as an implement of sport is attested by
the balls found associated with objects used in other games in old
Egypt, where it was known at least 4,700 years ago. Games of ball
are common among savage and barbarous people, and ball games of
Burma, Siam, India, and Japan, as well as those of the North American
Indians, are suggested in this case. With the ball games are
the sticks used in a widely diffused game which we commonly know
as “Tip-cat.” Tip-cat is played with a block of wood, about six
inches in length, which is struck with a small club or bat and
knocked into the air. The rules for playing are somewhat complicated,
and as far as they have been compared, appear to be much
the same all over the earth. The oldest specimen is from Kahûn,
Egypt, of 2800 B. C. Tip-cat is known by the Syrians in the Plaisance,
who have contributed the sticks they use in the game they
call <em>Hab</em>. In Persia it is called <em>Guk tchub</em>, “frog-wood,” a name
given to it, like our name “cat,” from the way the small stick
leaps into the air. In China the game is called <em>Ta-pang</em>, “to knock
the stick,” and the Chinese laborers in the United States call the
“cat” <em>To tsz</em>, or “Little Peach.” In Japan the game is called <em>In
ten</em>; the small stick <em>ko</em>, “son,” and the long one <em>oya</em>, “parent.” In
India the game is called <em>Gutti danda</em>; in Burma, <em>Kyitha</em>, and in
Russian <em>Kosley</em>, “goat,” a suggestive name like that of Persia and
our own name, “cat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The wicker baskets or <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">cestas</span></i> for the Spanish game of ball or
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pelota</span></i>, now so popular in Spain, are next shown, with the flat bat
used by the Spaniards in ball games. A very ancient English bat
for trap ball appears with them, and these are followed by the implements
used in the current American and English ball games
exhibited by Messrs. A. G. Spalding &amp; Bros. of Chicago. Cricket,
Baseball, Football, Golf, Polo, La Crosse and Lawn Tennis, Racket
and Battledore and Shuttlecock, are displayed in order, and with the
last are exhibited the Zuñi Indian and the Japanese form of this
game and the Chinese shuttlecock, which is kicked with the toes.
The tossing games comprise Jackstones, Cup and Ball, Grace Hoops,
and Quoits, and ring games of various kinds, and include the iron
quoits <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rayuelas</span></i>, used in Spain. The stone quoit games of the
Zuñis, and of the Tarahumara Indians are also exhibited. The North
American Indian forms of the Cup and Ball game comprise the
<em>Ar-too-is</em>, or “match-making” game of the Penobscots, exhibited by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Chief Joseph Nicolar of Oldtown Me., and the Sioux game played
with the phalangal bones of the deer. The comparatively new game
“Tiddledy winks” follows, leading up to a recent German game
called the “Newest War Game,” in which the men or “winks” are
played upon a board upon which are represented two opposing
fortresses. The games of tossing cowries and coins are next suggested,
with the game played by Chinese children with olive seeds.
Many natural objects are exhibited that are used by children in
playing games resembling marbles, to which artificial objects they
appear to lead. In Burma the seeds of a large creeper, the <em>Eutada
Pursoetha</em>, are employed in a game called <em>Gohunyin</em>, one of the
commonest forms of gambling known in that country. In Asia
Minor, knuckle-bones of sheep, which are often weighted with lead,
are used in the same manner, and in Damascus and the cities in
connection with marbles. Marbles themselves, in the varieties
known to commerce, are next exhibited.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE III.<br /> BOWLING, BILLIARDS, CURLING, AND SHUFFLE BOARD.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The objects used to illustrate the games of Bowling, Billiards, and
Shuffle Board were made for this exhibit by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender
Company of Chicago, by whom they are displayed, and
comprise miniature tables for these games of remarkable accuracy
and beauty of finish. On the north side of the case may be seen
the implements used in the game of Croquet as it is played at the
present day. The first games of Croquet manufactured in the United
States were made from an English sample in 1863. The Chicago
Curling Club here displays a collection of representative objects, including
three sets of Curling stones and the medals and trophies
belonging to the club and its members.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE IV.<br /> MERRELLS, FOX AND GEESE, CHESS, AND DRAUGHTS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>An attempt has been made to bring together as large a number
as possible of the simple board games like Merrells and Fox and
Geese, with the hope that they would throw light upon that much
discussed question, the origin of the game of Chess. The Chinese,
Korean, Japanese, and Siamese, Malayan and Samoan forms of several
such games are exhibited. It is curious to note that the peculiar
board used in the Japanese Fox and Geese game, called <em>Juroku
Musashi</em>, or “Sixteen Soldiers,” is the same as one from Peru for
a similar game. The inference is that they are both of Spanish introduction,
which seems to be confirmed by the statement that the
Japanese game was first known in that country in the sixteenth century.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Merrells is displayed in a board made in the Damascus house
in the Plaisance, where the Syrians call it <em>Edris</em>, and in a diagram
obtained from Chinese laborers from Canton, who call it <em>Sám k’í</em>, or
the “Three Game,” as well as by European boards.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Japanese board for that famous game which the Japanese call
<em>Go</em> and the Chinese <em>Wei k’i</em>, or the “Game of Surrounding,” follows.
This is the game which is often erroneously referred to as
chess, in China. The Japanese name of this board, <em>Go-ban</em>, has
furnished the name which we have applied to the simple game of
“Go Bang,” which we also got from Japan.</p>

<p class='c007'>A board and men for a highly developed game, somewhat like
draughts, played by the Zuñi Indians of New Mexico, furnishes a
striking object for speculation and research. The board is a square
divided into 144 small equal squares, each of which is crossed by two
intersecting diagonal lines. The moves are made one square at a time
along those diagonal lines, the pieces being placed at the angles of
the squares. Two or four persons play. They each start with six
men, and their object is to get their men across to the other side
and occupy their opponent’s places, capturing as many of his pieces
as possible by the way. A piece is taken by getting it between two
others, as in the modern Egyptian game of <em>Seega</em>, and the first piece
thus taken may be replaced by an extra piece belonging to the player
who makes the capture, which may move on the straight as well
as the diagonal lines and is called the “Priest of the Bow.” This
game, which was arranged and is exhibited by Mr. Frank Hamilton
Cushing, is called <em>A-wi-thlák-na-kwe</em>, which he translates as “Stone
warriors.” Mr. Edward Falkener, in his work entitled “Games
Ancient and Oriental,” which he lent for exhibition here, has published
a restoration of the ancient Egyptian game of Senat from
fragments of Egyptian boards which have come down from 1600 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>
The game as thus restored is in some respects similar to the Zuñi
game, the men being taken as in <em>Seega</em> by getting them between two
others. The Zuñi game, however, may be regarded as in advance of
any other board game, even of our own civilization, until we come to
the true game of Chess. Chess stands alone among games. We do
not find the links that connect it with lower forms of board games,
and the Indian game from which our own is derived almost without
change is the source from which the many variants of the Chess
game doubtless originated. Several of these offspring of the Indian
Chess are shown in the north side of this case, including the chess
games of Burma, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, China, and Japan. A
Moorish board is exhibited with them, and European chessmen and
boards follow. A finely carved ivory chess set represents the pieces
that are made for export by the Chinese at Canton. Draughts, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>in the opinion of Mr. Edward B. Tylor may be regarded as a modern
and simplified form of Chess, now follow, and here are shown two
sets of interesting German draughtsmen of the eighteenth century.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE V.<br /> AMERICAN BOARD GAMES, GAMES OF LOTS, LOTTO, CHINESE LOTTERIES.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The games played on boards, like Merrells and Draughts, manufactured
by Messrs. McLaughlin Brothers and E. J. Horsman of
New York, and the Milton Bradley Company of Springfield, Mass.,
are found in this case. Many of them appear to have been suggested
by the Oriental games such as are shown in the preceding
collection.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are followed by games of Lots, a class of games extremely
common among the North American Indians. The Haida and other
tribes of the northwest coast play with sticks which are painted
and carved. According to Dr. Franz Boas the sticks are thrown
down violently upon a hard piece of skin, and the object of the
game is to pick out the unmarked sticks, which alone count. The
designs on the sticks are of the greatest interest, and a set of plaster
casts of a very finely carved set in the United States National
Museum at Washington, which are displayed through the courtesy
of Professor Otis T. Mason, exhibit these peculiarities. The wooden
discs from Puget Sound are concealed beneath a mat, and the
players endeavor to select a particular disc. Guessing games of
various kinds were very general among our Indians. The two
bones, one wrapped with thread, which were used by the Alaska
Indians in such a game, are exhibited with similar bones from the
Utes. They were held in the hands, the player guessing which
contained the marked one. The balls of buffalo hair with which the
Omahas play a similar game are also displayed, with the moccasins
in which the object was sometimes concealed. These games were
played with the accompaniment of songs. Miss Alice C. Fletcher
exhibits the music of two of these gambling songs used by the Omahas,
and in Dr. Washington Matthews’ “Navajo Gambling Songs,”
a copy of which may be seen in this case, the songs sung in the
game of <em>Kêsitce</em>, played with eight moccasins, in one of which a
stone is concealed, are recorded. Among the Zuñis and Mokis, cups
like dice cups were used to cover the ball. The Moki cups here
exhibited have been used in a sacred game and then sacrificed with
“plume sticks,” as is shown by the small holes with which they
are pierced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Games can be made to throw much light upon the social and political
institutions of many peoples. This fact is rendered conspicuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>in the implements for the Chinese lotteries which are shown in
this series. They comprise the paraphernalia of the <em>Pák-kòp-piu</em> or
“Game of the White Pigeon Ticket,” the <em>Tsz’ fá</em>, or “Character
Flowering,” and the <em>Wei Sing</em> or “Game of Guessing Surnames.”
In the first, the tickets are imprinted with the first eighty characters
of the <em>Tsin tsz’ man</em>, or Thousand Character Classic, one of
the elementary text-books of Chinese children. In the second, the
writer of the lottery assists his patrons in their effort to guess the
hidden character, by an original ode, in which it must be in some
way referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third is the game of guessing the name of the successful candidate
at the Governmental Literary Examinations. Upon them all
the peculiar literary traditions of the Chinese people have left their
imprint.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE VI.<br /> KNUCKLE-BONES AND DICE, DOMINOES, EVOLUTION OF PLAYING CARDS, CHINESE PLAYING CARDS, PARCHESI, PATOLI, AND KAB.</h3>

<p class='c006'>No method of appealing to chance is more common than that of
tossing some object in the air and deciding the result by its fall. A
coin is often used at the present day, and many natural and artificial
objects have found currency for this purpose. Nuts, cowrie shells,
and the knuckle-bones of animals have been used from the earliest
times, and the last, the knuckle-bones, have become the parent of
many of our modern games. The American Indians across the entire
continent played a game with marked plum-stones and other
objects which had many points of resemblance with games played
by other people with dotted cubical dice. The specimens of such
games here exhibited comprise the game played with marked bone
discs in a wooden bowl by the Penobscot Indians of Oldtown, Me.,
contributed by Chief Joseph Nicolar; a set of marked plum-stones
and the basket and tallies used by the Sioux, and a similar set of
marked bone and wooden pieces, with the basket, from the Arapahoes.
Among the Pueblo Indians of the southwestern United States
blocks of wood are used in the same manner as dice, and among
the Arabs of northern Africa numerical values are attributed to
the throws made with four and six similar pieces of reed. In India,
cowries are used. Sortilege is also practised with the implements
that are used in games. In China, the cleft root stock of the bamboo
is commonly employed in fortune-telling, and the blocks, which
form part of the accessories of nearly all Chinese temples, may be
seen upon the altar of the Chinese God of War, commonly appealed
to by Chinese gamblers, erected in this Section. Knuckle-bones or
astragali present a most interesting subject for investigation. From
a prehistoric knuckle-bone of terra-cotta from Cuzco, Peru (No. 340),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>in the collection of Señor Montes in this building it appears that
they were used by the ancient Peruvians. The Peruvian Indians at
the present day use four knuckle-bones as dice in a game. It is
known in Kechua as <em>tava</em>, a word meaning four, which should not in
the opinion of Señor Montes be confounded with the Spanish word
for knuckle-bone, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">taba</span></i>, from which he does not think it was derived.</p>

<p class='c007'>Knuckle-bones were used in games in old Egypt, as was shown
by the ivory specimens found with other gaming implements in the
tomb of Queen Hatasu, <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> 1600, and are constantly referred to by
the Greek and Latin authors. Numerical values were attributed to
each of the four throws, which among the Romans were designated
as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Supinum</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pronum</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Planum</span></i>, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tortuosum</span></i>, and estimated as
three, five, one, and six. Among the Arabs, and at the present day
throughout western Asia, the four sides receive the names of ranks
of human society; thus among the Persians, according to Dr. Hyde,
they are called <em>Duzd</em>, “thief,” <em>Dibban</em>, “peasant,” <em>Vezir</em>, and <em>Shah</em>,
and so with the Turks, Syrians, Armenians, and other peoples. A
pair of natural bones from the right and left leg of the sheep are
commonly used, which among the Syrians of Damascus are designated
respectively as <em>yisr</em> and <em>yemene</em>, “left and right.” The transition
from these <em>kabat</em>, as the Arabs call them, from <em>kab</em> meaning
“ankle” or “ankle-bone,” to the cubical dotted dice was an easy
one. The same numerical values and social designations were
attributed to four sides of the cubical dice, as are given to the
knuckle-bones, and it is curious to note that the significant throws
with cubical dice in China are those that bear the numbers assigned
to the astragali throws. The modern East Indian dice which are
exhibited will be seen from the arrangement of the “threes” to
be made in pairs, like the natural astragali, and the pair receives in
India the name of <em>kabatain</em>, the dual of <em>kab</em>, the name which is also
applied to the pair of astragali. The Syrian dice used in <em>Towla</em>, or
backgammon, are marked in the same way, as well as the Japanese
dice used in the similar game of <em>Sugoroku</em> or “double sixes.” A
pair of ancient Roman dice which I purchased in Florence show
that the Romans practised the same arrangement, and are especially
significant. The invention of the cubical dotted die must have
occurred at a comparatively early time. The oldest die of which I
have any knowledge is displayed in this collection, a large pottery
die from the Greek colony of Naucratis, Egypt, belonging, according
to the discoverer, Mr. Flinders Petrie, to 600 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> The dice found
in Babylonia and Egypt appear to have been associated with foreign
influences.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dice were carried over from India to China, where we find the
next stage in their development. Here the twenty-one possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>throws with two dice are each given a name, and in the case of the
double sixes, double aces, double fours, and three and ace, these
names are those of the triune powers of Heaven, Earth, and Man, and
the Harmony that unites them. This change in nomenclature, in
which the social terms of Shah, Vizier, etc., were replaced with cosmical
ones, is characteristic of the way in which China adapts and
absorbs foreign ideas. A game with two dice remains the principal
dice game in China at the present day. In it the twenty-one possible
throws are divided into two series, one consisting of the throws
<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='vincula'>6</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>1</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>4<br /><span class='vincula'>4</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>3<br /><span class='vincula'>1</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>5<br /><span class='vincula'>5</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>3<br /><span class='vincula'>3</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>2<br /><span class='vincula'>2</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>5<br /><span class='vincula'>6</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>4<br /><span class='vincula'>6</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>6</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>5</span></span>, called <em>man</em>, “civil,” and the other, <span class='fraction'>5<br /><span class='vincula'>4</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='vincula'>3</span></span>,
<span class='fraction'>5<br /><span class='vincula'>3</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='vincula'>2</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>4<br /><span class='vincula'>3</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>5<br /><span class='vincula'>2</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>4<br /><span class='vincula'>2</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>3<br /><span class='vincula'>2</span></span>, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>4</span></span>, and <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>2</span></span>, designated as <em>mò</em>, or “military.” In the
twelfth century, according to Chinese records, dotted tablets, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>,
dominoes, were invented. Chinese dominoes consist of 21 pieces
representing the 21 throws with two dice of which the 11 pieces of
the <em>man</em> series are usually duplicated to form a complete set, which
numbers 32 dominoes. In southern China, long wooden dominoes
are employed. When paper was used instead of wood we have the
playing card.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject of Chinese playing cards has been illustrated in an
admirable and exhaustive manner by W. H. Wilkinson, Esq., H. B.
M. Consul at Swatow, who has lent for exhibition a series of Chinese
cards, dice, and dominoes collected at no less than fourteen different
cities in China, from Peking on the north, and Tai yuan, down
along the coast at Nanking, Shanghai, Ningpo, Wenchow, Fuchow,
Swatow, Canton, to Hongkong. Cards are also shown from various
places along the Yellow River, from Chung King eastward to
Nanking. The cards in this collection are arranged according to the
symbols or marks distinguishing them, which Mr. Wilkinson divides
into four classes, according as they are derived:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. From the sapek or cash, and its multiples.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Through dominoes from dice.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. From the Chinese Chess game.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. From other sources.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very complete account may be expected from Mr. Wilkinson,
who has displayed here what is doubtless the most perfect collection
of Chinese cards ever exhibited. The miscellaneous cards in this
collection are drawn from western China and bear some resemblance,
according to Mr. Wilkinson, to the “Proverbs” and “Happy Families”
of Europe and America. They include the cards based on a
writing lesson, cards based on numbers, and cards based on a lucky
formula.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to the subject of dice, the special implements used in
dice divination in India are shown, as well as illustrations of the
methods employed in telling fortunes with dominoes in China and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Korea; these forming part of the material used in the investigation
of the origin of dominoes. Japanese and Siamese dice are also
exhibited with the East Indian and Chinese specimens, as well as
dice made in various parts of Europe, comprising a pair of iron dice
purchased at Perugia, which, although presumably modern, have the
dots arranged with the 6–5, 4–2, and 3–1 opposite, like those of old
Etruria, instead of the sums of the spots on opposite sides being
equal to seven, as is otherwise general. With the dice are the spinning
dice of various countries, including the East Indian <em>Chukree</em>,
the Chinese <em>Ch’e me</em>, and the corresponding dice of Japan and Siam.
A variety of dominoes are also displayed, including those of Korea,
which are identical with those of China, and the Siamese dominoes,
which were also borrowed from the latter country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pair of knuckle-bones appear to be the parent of many of that
large class of games which Mr. Tylor describes as the “backgammon
group.” With reference to dice-backgammon the evidence in this
particular is very direct, but the similar games played with cowries
and wooden blocks, for which even a greater antiquity may be
claimed, there is a likelihood of independent origin. Several games
of the latter class from India, North America, and Egypt, types of
which have been referred to by Mr. Tylor, are exhibited in this collection.
The first, <em>Pachisi</em>, is the most popular game in India. It
is played around a board, usually made of cloth, in the form of a
cross, according to the throws with cowries. Six or seven shells
are ordinarily used, and count according as the apertures fall. When
long dice of ivory are employed, the game is called <em>Chausar</em>. This
game was introduced from India into the United States, where it
was first published in 1860 under the name of Parchesi, and has
become very popular. Mr. Cushing has set up beside the <em>Pachisi</em>
a Zuñi game, which the Zuñis call <em>Ta sho lí wé</em>, or “wooden cane
cards,” and which has many points of resemblance to the East
Indian game. The moves are made according to the throws with
wooden blocks three inches in length, painted red and black upon
their two faces, around a circle of forty stones which is broken at
the top and bottom, and the right and left, by four openings called
the “Doorways of the four directions.” This game embodies many
of the mythical conceptions of the Zuñis. It is played by two or
four players, who use colored splints to mark their course around
the circle. These splints, which are placed at starting in the doorway
to which they correspond, have the following symbolism: At
the top, Yellow, North, The Wind, Winter. At the left, Blue,
West, Water, Spring. At the bottom, Red, South, Fire, Summer.
At the right, White, East, Seed or Earth, Autumn. The colors of
the two wooden blocks symbolize the two conditions of man: Red,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Light or Wakefulness; Black, Darkness or Sleep. The throws with
the blocks, which are tossed, ends down, upon a disc of sandstone
placed in the middle of the circle, are as follows: 3 red count 10;
3 black count 5; 2 red and 1 black count 3; 1 red and 2 black count 1.</p>

<p class='c007'>A count of three red gives another throw. When four play, the
North and West move around from right to left, and the South and
East from left to right. When a player’s move ends at a division of
the circle occupied by his adversaries’ piece, he takes it up and sends
it back to the beginning. It is customary to make the circuit of the
stones either four or six times, beans or corn of the seven varieties
being used as counters. This game forms one of the seven sacred
games of the Zuñis, and its antetype, <em>Sho lí we</em>, or “Cane Cards,”
is one of the four games that are sacrifices to the God of War and
Fate. The sacred form of the game is called <em>Tein thla nah na tá
sho lí we</em>, or literally, “Of all the regions wood cane cards, and the
blocks which are thrown in it bear complicated marks, consisting of
bands of color on one side.” In the sacred game, the players are
chosen with great care with reference to their totem, and the region
to which it belongs. A much more complete account of this game
may be expected from Mr. Cushing himself, from the ample material
which he has placed at my disposal. Side by side with <em>Ta sho
lí we</em> is the corresponding game as played by the Apache and Navajos,
which has been set up by Antonio Apache. It lacks the color
symbolism, but the principle is identical. The Navajos call it <em>Set
tilth</em>, which Captain John G. Bourke, U. S. A., tells me should be
transliterated <em>Tze-chis</em>, or <em>Zse tilth</em>, and means literally, “stonestick.”
The circle of stones, he says, is called <em>Tze nasti</em>, “Stone
circle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut. H. L. Scott, U. S. A., has contributed the implements for a
similar game of the Kiowas, which is known as the “Awl Game.”
It is called by the Kiowas <em>Zohn ahl</em>, that is, <em>Zohn</em>, “creek,” and <em>ahl</em>,
“wood.” A detailed account of it will appear elsewhere, furnished
to the writer by Lieutenant Scott, who states that the Comanches
have a similar game which they play with eight ahl sticks, which are
two feet or more long.</p>

<p class='c007'>These games are all similar to the Mexican Patoli, as described
by the early Spanish chroniclers. A picture of the latter game from
an early Hispano-American manuscript, reproduced from the original
in Florence by its discoverer, Mrs. Zelia Nuttall, is exhibited
in this connection. The method of play among the Aztecs is here
shown, and it is curious to note that they used a diagram or board
in the form of a cross, like that of the East Indian Pachisi. In
the Malayan archipelago, a stone is placed in the centre upon
which dice are thrown in games, as among the North American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Indians. Mr. Tylor has set forth the conclusions which may be
drawn from these resemblances, but the matter is still open for discussion.
Another game remains to be noticed, played with wooden
blocks as dice: the Arab game of <em>Tab</em>, in which men are moved on
a board according to the throws of four slips of palm. These slips,
about eight inches in length, are left with one face of the natural
color, and the other showing the whiter interior of the palm, these
sides being called black and white respectively. The throws count
as follows: 4 black, 6; 4 white, 4; 3 white, 3; 2 white, 2;
1 white, 1.</p>

<p class='c007'>The implements displayed for this game were made in the Cairo
street. No more curious ethnographical parallels are presented in
the Exposition than that of the Arabs in the Plaisance, and the
Navajos beside the South Lagoon, both playing these curiously similar
games.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE VII.<br /> BACKGAMMON, SUGOROKU, AND THE GAME OF GOOSE, EAST INDIAN, JAPANESE, AND SIAMESE CARDS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>According to Mr. Tylor, dice-backgammon makes its appearance
plainly in classic history. The game of twelve lines (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">duodecim
scripta</span></i>) was played throughout the Roman Empire and passed on,
with little change, through mediæval Europe, carrying its name of
tabulæ, tables; its modern representatives being French Tric trac,
English Backgammon, etc. Among the ancient Greeks <em>Kubeia</em>, or
“dice playing,” is shown by various classical passages to be of the
nature of backgammon. The pearl-inlaid backgammon board here
shown is from Damascus, where the game is known as <em>Towla</em>,
“tables.” A Siamese board exhibited by the government of Siam,
with other games, through its royal commissioner Phra Surya, has
departed little from the ancient type. Backgammon is known in
China as <em>Sheung Luk</em>, “double sixes,” and in Japan by the corresponding
name of <em>Sugoroku</em>. The popular games, both in China
and Japan, however, are not played with men upon a set board, but
resemble the games with many stations, which are common in
Europe and America.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most notable of the Chinese games of this class is the one
which is called <em>Shing kun to</em>, or “The Tables of the Promotion of
Officials,” a game which has been known to scholars, through Dr.
Hyde’s account, as “The Game of the Promotion of Mandarins.”
It is played by two or more persons upon a large paper diagram,
upon which are printed the titles of the different officials and dignitaries
of the Chinese government. The moves are made according
to the throws with four cubical dice, and the players, whose positions
upon the diagram are indicated by notched or colored splints,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>are advanced or set back, according to their throws. The paper
chart here exhibited was purchased in a Chinese shop in New York
city. It was printed in Canton, and bears an impression about
twenty-three inches square. This is divided into sixty-three compartments,
exclusive of the central one and the place for entering
at the lower right-hand corner. The latter contains the names of
thirteen different starting-points, from <em>yan shang</em>, or “Honorary
Licentiate,” down to <em>t’ung shang</em>, or “student,” between which are
included the positions of <em>t’ín man shang</em>, “astrologer,” and <em>í shang</em>,
“physician.” These are entered at the commencement of the game
by the throws of “three, four, five, six,” three “fours,” three “sixes,”
three “fives,” three “threes,” three “twos,” and three “ones;” and
then in the same manner double “fours,” and so on down to double
“ones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sixty-three compartments, representing as many classes of
officials or degrees of rank, comprise three hundred and ninety-seven
separate titles, of which the highest, and the highest goal of
the game, is that of man <em>fá tín tái hok sz’</em>, or “Grand Secretary.”
This, however, under favorable conditions, can only be reached by
a player who starts from a favorable point, advancement in the game
being regulated by rules similar to those which actually regulate
promotion under government. Thus, a player whose fortune it is to
enter as physician or astrologer can only obtain promotion in the
line of his service, and must be content with a minor goal, as he is
ineligible to the high civil office of “Grand Secretary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dice are thrown into a bowl placed in the centre of the sheet,
the players throwing in turn, and each continuing to throw until he
makes a cast of doublets or higher. It is noticeable that “fours,”
as in Dr. Hyde’s account, constitute the highest throw. A pair of
“fours,” according to the rules, is to be reckoned as <em>tak</em>, “virtue,”
and leads to a higher place than those of the other numbers. Sixes
are next highest and are to be reckoned as <em>ts’oi</em>, “genius;” and in
the same manner, in descending degree, “fives” are to be reckoned
as <em>kung</em>, “skill;” “threes” as <em>léung</em>, “forethought;” “twos” as
<em>yau</em>, “tractability;” and “ones,” <em>chong</em>, “stupidity.” The game is
much complicated by being played for money or counters, which
is necessary under the rules. By this means advancement may be
purchased, degradation compounded for, and the winner of a high
position rewarded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main point of difference between the game as it exists to-day,
and as described by Dr. Hyde, is the number of dice employed, six
being the number mentioned by him. The enlarged form of the
diagram is of minor importance, as he himself says that the names
of officials written on the tablet are many or few, according to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>pleasure of the players. With the game of <em>Shing kún</em> to may be
seen a copy of Dr. Hyde’s treatise, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Ludis Orientalibis</span></cite>, containing
the reproduction of the chart of the game which he made in
London 200 years ago. The names of titles of the Ming dynasty
appear upon it, in curious contrast to those of the present Tartar
domination. The two hundredth anniversary of the date of the
imprimatur of this precious volume occurs on the 20th of September
of this very year.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a very great variety of games of this character in Japan,
new ones being published annually at the season of the New Year.
Illustrations of the more formal game played upon a board divided
into twelve parts are figured in the Chinese-Japanese cyclopædias.
According to the <em>Kum mō dzu e tai sei</em>, the twelve compartments,
called in Japanese <em>me</em>, or “eyes,” symbolize the twelve months, and
the black and white stones with which the game is played, day and
night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Italy contributes several forms of the dice game played upon a
board having many stations. The oldest specimen in the collection,
purchased in Parma, is a manuscript game bearing the title of
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Oca Franchese</span></i>. Others printed in Florence bear the printed labels
of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuoco dell’ oca</span></i> and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuoco del Barone</span></i>, while late examples more
fanciful, both in name and design, appear as <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuoco del Tramway</span></i>
and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Battaglia del 48</span></i>. A French game is shown under its proper
title as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jeu de l’oie</span></i>, beside which is placed a similar American game
published as the “Game of Goose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of packs of Oriental cards other than Chinese are contained
in this case, among which are included several packs of East
Indian Hindu cards which they call <em>Gungeefa</em>. They are all circular,
varying in diameter in the different sets from 1⅝ to 3⅛ inches. One
pack from Lucknow comprises eight suits, each composed of twelve
cards, ten of which are “numerals,” from one to ten. The two
remaining cards are designated respectively as <em>Badsha</em> and <em>Sawar</em>.
No satisfactory explanation has yet been afforded as to their origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Japanese call the cards which are now current in Japan by
the name of <em>Karuta</em>, a word evidently derived from the Portuguese
<i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">carta</span></i>. Those commonly used by gamblers, a pack of which is exhibited
by Mrs. J. K. Van Rensellaer, are called <em>Hana Karuta</em>, or
“Flower cards,” and comprise forty-eight pieces, a number, it will be
observed, identical with that of the present Spanish pack. They
bear pictures, chiefly flowers, emblematic of the twelve months, four
cards being placed under each. Their names are as follows: <em>Matsu</em>,
“pine;” <em>Sakusa</em>, “cherries;” <em>Momidzi</em>, “maple;” <em>Butan</em>, “wild
rose;” <em>Hagi</em>, Lespedeza; <em>Kiku</em>, “golden-colored daisy;” <em>Kiri</em>,
Paulonia; <em>Fudzi</em>, Wisteria; <em>Soba</em>, “tiger lily;” <em>Ume</em>, “plum-tree;”
<em>Yama</em>, “mountain;” and <em>Ame</em>, “rain.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>The <em>Iroha</em>, or Proverb cards, also consist of ninety-six cards, half
of which bear a picture and one of the forty-seven characters of the
<em>Iroha</em>, or Japanese syllabary. Each of the other cards is inscribed
with a proverb, the first word of which is written with one of the
characters. There are several methods of play, the commonest being
that of laying out all the picture cards face up. One of the older
players reads the proverbs in turn, while the others endeavor to select
the card from the table bearing the corresponding initial character.
The <em>Uta Karuta</em>, or “Cards with songs,” contain, according to Mr.
Karl Himly, the well-known one hundred songs (<em>Hiyaku nin issiu</em>,
1235 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>), or the poems of the “Old and New Collection” (<em>Ho kin
schiu</em>, 905 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>). The picture cards have the pictures of the poet or
poetess, with the commencement of the poems. The rest is on the
corresponding cards. The game is the same as that played with
the <em>Iroha Karuta</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE VIII.<br /> AMERICAN BOARD GAMES PLAYED WITH DICE.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The first of American board games played with dice is said to
be the “Mansion of Happiness.” This game is said to have been
published in 1852, and copied from an English game. Thirty-three
specimens of similar games published in this country are exhibited.
They form a small part, however, of the entire number.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE IX.<br /> TAROTS, TAROCCHINO, AND MINCHIATE. TYPES OF ITALIAN CARDS. MANUFACTURE OF PLAYING CARDS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The question of the origin of playing cards in Europe, whether
they were introduced from the East, or an independent invention in
France, Italy, or Germany, has been the object of much discussion.
It may be regarded as conclusively settled that playing cards were
invented in China in the twelfth century, and in view of the remarkable
similarities between the card and card games of China and those
of Europe which have been brought to light by Mr. Wilkinson, it may
be profitable to suspend further consideration of the matter until the
results of his studies are made public. Italy appears to be the oldest
home of the playing card in Europe, and the earliest Italian packs
are said to be those which the Italians call Tarocchi. Several types
of these cards are found in Italy. According to Willshire these
games are known as the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tarots</span></i> of Venice or Lombardy, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tarocchino</span></i>
of Bologna, and the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minchiate</span></i> of Florence. The first of these,
the old Venetian Tarot, he regards as the parent of all. The sequence
consists of 78 cards, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, of 22 emblematic cards of Tarots
proper, and 56 numeral cards made up of 16 figures or court cards,
and 40 pip cards. The 22 Tarot cards bear emblematic designs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>which appear to be borrowed from a series of prints which are known
to collectors as the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tarocchi</span></i> of Mantegna or the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carte di Baldini</span></i>.
The emblematic cards in the Venetian series usually bear the following
inscriptions: 1. La Bagattel. 2. La Papessa. 3. L’Imperatrice.
4. L’Imperatore. 5. Il Papa. 6. Gli Amanti. 7. Il Carro. 8. La
Guistizia. 9. L’Eremita. 10. Ruot. della For. 11. La Forza.
12. L’Appeso. 13. &#8196;&#8196;&#8196;&#8196;&#8196;&#8196;. 14. La Temperan. 15. Il Diavolo.
16. La Torre. 17. Le Stelle. 18. La Luna. 19. Il Sole. 20. Il
Giudizio. 21. Il Mondo. 22. Il Matto.</p>

<p class='c007'>No name is placed upon the 13th, which usually bears a skeleton
with a scythe, representing “death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The second game, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tarocchino</span></i> of Bologna, though a direct
descendant of the ancient Venetian tarots, is not so old as the third
game, or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minchiate</span></i> of Florence. The chief characteristic of the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tarocchino</span></i>, its name a diminutive of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">tarocchi</span></i>, is the suppression in
it of the 2, 3, 4, and 5 of each numeral suit, thus reducing the
numeral cards from 56 to 40. This modification of the tarot game
was invented in Bologna, early in the fifteenth century, by Francesco
Fibbia, Prince of Pisa, an exile in that city, dying there in 1419.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third game is the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minchiate</span></i> of Florence. It is more complicated
than the Venetian game, twenty additional cards being added
to the emblematic series. A pack of modern Venetian tarot made
in Milan, which are remarkable for their beautifully engraved and
painted designs, a pack of modern <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tarocchino</span></i> from Bologna, and a
pack of seventeenth century <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Minchiate</span></i>, are displayed in the south
side of this case. All of these cards are in current use in different
parts of Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The suit marks of Italian cards consist of money, cups, swords,
and clubs, called <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">danari</span></i>, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">coppe</span></i>, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">spade</span></i>, and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bastoni</span></i>. The four court
cards of the numeral suits are known respectively as <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Re</span></i>, King,
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Regina</span></i> or <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Reina</span></i>, Queen, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cavallo</span></i>, Knight, and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fante</span></i>, Knave. The
regular cards, as opposed to those which include the emblematic
series, are distinguished by certain peculiarities in the designs of the
court cards in different parts of Italy. The distinctive cards of
Florence, Milan, and Naples are exhibited in this case, together with
several interesting packs upon which all the designs, except an indication
of the value at the top, have given place to texts designed to
afford instruction in history, geography, etc. A remarkable pack of
this character, exhibited by Dr. G. Brown Goode, of Washington, is in
manuscript and is intended to teach geography.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Chatto, on the earliest cards he had ever seen the
figures had been executed by means of stencils, this being the case
both in the cards of 1440 and those known as the Stukely cards.
There are exhibited in this case the stencils, brush, and unfinished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>card sheets from a card maker in Florence, who still practises this
ancient method of manufacture. The cards on the south side of this
case, which in common with all others not specially mentioned are
exhibited by the University of Pennsylvania, represent the cards
made at the present day in no less than eighteen Italian cities by
some twenty-nine makers. They were collected for the University
Museum by Mr. Francis C. Macauley of Florence. The cards of
Florence, Bologna, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Ferrara, Padua, Treviso,
Udine, Novara, Turin, Sesia, Bergamo, Brescia, Genoa, Perugia,
Naples, and Bari are included in the collection, in which an opportunity
is afforded to observe the peculiarities of the cards of the different
Italian cities. A distinctive character of the marks of the
numeral suits of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">spade</span></i> and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bastoni</span></i> is the mode in which they are
interlaced or connected together in place of standing separately or
apart. It is interesting to note that in the cards made in and for
southern Italy this peculiarity does not exist, they being almost
identical with the cards made in Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cards of Austria succeed those of Italy. The pack exhibited
from Trent is like those of Italy, but the distinctively German cards
predominate among those made in Vienna and the northern cities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The suit marks of old German cards consist of hearts, bells, leaves,
and acorns, which they call respectively <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herzen</span></i> (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roth</span></i>), <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schellen</span></i>, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Laub</span></i>
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">grün</span></i>), and <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eicheln</span><a id='t222'></a></i>. The court cards of the German pack are
usually three in number, the peculiarity of the true German pack
being that the queen is omitted and an upper valet or <i>Obermann</i> put
in her place. They consist of the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">König</span></i> or “King,” the <i>Obermann</i>,
and the <i>Untermann</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tarocchi cards are found in Germany under the name of <em>Taroks</em>,
and a number of Tarok packs manufactured in Austria appear in
this collection. Special names appear on their labels, as <em>Trieste
Tarok</em>, <em>Kaffee Tarok</em>, etc., and the tarots proper bear a variety of
emblems and designs different from those of Italy. They are usually
numbered at top and bottom with Roman numerals from I. to XXI.</p>

<p class='c007'>Willshire has pointed out that the Italians early suppressed the
emblematic cards in a game which was termed <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trappola</span></i>, in which
the true tarots were abolished, as likewise the three, four, five, and
six of each numeral suit. This game, he states, was still in vogue
in Silesia when Breitkopf wrote (1784). An interesting Austrian
pack of this character is shown under the name of <em>Trappolier Spiel</em>,
in which the shape as well as the suit marks of the Italian tarots
are displayed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The German cards manufactured in Germany are prefaced by a
series of reprints of German cards of the last century exhibited by
Mr. Macauley. They were obtained by him through the courtesy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the Bavarian National Museum in Munich, for which they were made
from the original blocks of the old Munich card makers that have
been conserved in the Museum.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE XI.<br /> GERMAN CARDS (CONTINUED), SWISS, DANISH, SWEDISH, AND RUSSIAN CARDS. SPANISH, MEXICAN, AND APACHE CARDS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The collection of cards made in Germany comprises 53 packs, consisting
chiefly of the current cards manufactured by card makers in
Munich, Altenburg, Frankfort a. M., Berlin, Leipzig, and Breslau.
Among these is an extremely beautiful pack by B. Dondorf of Frankfort,
with pictures suggesting the four quarters of the globe, after
designs by Haussmann. Toy cards, patience cards, comic cards,
trick cards, and cards which are labelled “Gaigel cards” appear, as
well as cards made for special games, as the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hexen</span></i> or “witch” packs.
Many of the cards manufactured in Germany are seen to bear the
French suit marks of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cœurs</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carreaux</span></i>, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Piques</span></i>, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trèfles</span></i>, or
“hearts,” “diamonds,” “spades,” and “clubs,” instead of the old
German suit marks, and the court cards correspond at the same
time with those of France and England. There are a number of
packs with French suit marks, which bear pictures of Swiss scenery
and costumes. The cards made in Switzerland are from Schaffhausen
and Geneva, and comprise a variety of designs, including
those which are especially designated as Swiss cards, German cards,
and German Taroks. Belgium is represented by a German tarot
pack, and imitations of English cards made for Oriental markets.
Three packs of this character are shown, which were sent from
Johore, in the Malay Peninsula, with another pack from Beirut, in
Syria. The Russian cards in the collection, contributed by Madame
Semetchkin, the representative on the Russian Commission of the
“Institutions of the Empress Marie,” are similar to modern French
cards. The manufacture of playing cards in Russia is a monopoly
of the state, and the revenues accruing are devoted to the support
of the great charitable institution of which Madame Semetchkin is
the distinguished representative.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tarots or Tarocchi cards are not used in Spain, nor are they
found among Spanish cards. The regulation Spanish pack now consists
of 48 cards of four suits, called respectively <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Dineros</span></i>, “money,”
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Copas</span></i>, “cups,” <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Bastos</span></i>, “clubs,” and <i><span lang="osp" xml:lang="osp">Espadas</span></i>, “swords.” The
numerals run from one to nine, the ten being replaced with the
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caballo</span></i>. The court cards comprise the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sota</span></i>, or “knave,” the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caballo</span></i>,
or “knight,” and the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rey</span><a id='t223'></a></i>, or “king.” Cards manufactured at Vitoria,
Burgos, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Cadiz, and Palamos are
displayed. Great antiquity has been claimed for cards in Spain, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>it has been urged that this is the country through which Europe
received cards from the East, but heretofore no Spanish cards of assured
date earlier than 1600 have been known, and material evidence
has been lacking. There was exhibited at the Columbian Historical
Exposition in Madrid in 1892–93, a sheet of cards made in Mexico
in 1583, which has been preserved in the Archives of the Indies at
Seville, Spain, and which throw light upon the origin of Spanish
cards. A copy made in water-colors by an artist in Madrid is shown
in this collection. The original consists of an uncut sheet of about
11 by 17 inches, and bears on the back a pen and ink inscription
with the date 1583. The face displays an impression from a wooden
block of 24 cards each 2 by 3½ inches. They are colored in red,
blue, and black, and represent the court cards and aces of the suits
of money, cups, clubs, and swords, and ten numeral or pip cards of
the suit of swords. There are but three court cards for each suit,
instead of four as in the present Spanish pack. The marks of the
numeral suit consist of crossed swords, instead of being arranged as
on the Spanish cards now current, and strongly point to the Italian
affinities of early Spanish cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Side by side with this early Mexican pack is a colored plate representing
leather cards made by the Indians of South America, and
an original pack of leather cards used by the Apaches. From the
arrangement of the swords on both of these sets, which were copied
from cards introduced by the Spaniards, it appears that they were
initiated from the present type of Spanish cards. Such is not the
case with the corresponding marks on a pack of native cards from
the Celebes, which are also exhibited. Their Spanish origin is
clearly indicated by their number, 48, and by the devices, which still
bear a faint resemblance to those of Europe. The clubs and swords
on both are represented by crossed lines which confirm the impression
created by the Mexican pack. The Japanese “Hana Karuta,”
or “Flower Cards,” are also shown here, as another pack of Oriental
cards derived from those of Spain or Portugal. Their number, 48,
and their name, <em>karuta</em>, from the Portuguese <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">carta</span></i>, clearly suggests
their origin.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CASE XII.<br /> FRENCH, ENGLISH, AND AMERICAN PLAYING CARDS. FORTUNE-TELLING CARDS, DR. BUZBY, AUTHORS, AND MISCELLANEOUS CARD GAMES.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Tarocchi cards are called Tarots in France, and the French tarot
pack is similar to the Venetian. The earliest specimens of French
Tarots exhibited bear the name of Claude Burdel and the date 1751.
There is direct historic proof that France possessed cards at a very
early time in the accounts of the Treasurer of Charles VI., <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1392.
The earliest pack of French cards in this collection is one of which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>have not been able to determine the date. It bears the name Pierre
Montalan on the Knave of Spades and Claude Valentin on the
Knave of Clubs. A variety of modern French packs are shown,
including those made with Spanish suit marks and special cards for
various games. The French suit marks reappear on English cards,
and according to Willshire it is most probable that cards made their
way into England through France. He states that the time is not
known, but that we are safe in believing that cards were not in use
in England until after the reign of Henry IV. (1405), and that they
were certainly employed before 1463. The English cards here displayed
consist entirely of those of the present day, but this deficiency
in historical packs is compensated for in part by Lady Charlotte
Schreiber’s folio volume on English and Scottish, Dutch and Flemish
cards which she has loaned for this collection. The great work, of
which this is but the first volume, contains fac-similes of the cards
in Lady Charlotte Schreiber’s private collection, and reveals the
wealth of historical suggestions to be found upon playing cards, and
their value, as thus collected, to the antiquary and historian.</p>

<p class='c007'>America early received playing cards from Spain, and Spanish
cards are still made and imported into Spanish American countries.
In the United States English cards were naturally adopted. No
very early packs are shown, but some interesting cards are found in
the North American series, including a variety of cards with patriotic
emblems of the time of the Rebellion, as well as caricature
cards of the recent political campaigns. The collection closes with
the souvenir packs of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago. Mrs.
J. K. Van Rensellaer’s work, entitled “The Devil’s Picture Books,”
a copy of which is exhibited, contains many interesting particulars
concerning cards and card playing in America. Several interesting
card boxes are shown in this collection, with specimens of the
old-fashioned “fish” or card counters of mother-of-pearl, among
which are some that belonged to Robert Morris, the financier of
the Revolution. Treatises on American card games, exhibited by
Messrs. Dick &amp; Fitzgerald, conclude the series of playing cards
proper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the notions concerning the origin of cards in Europe is
one that they were first introduced by the gypsies, who used them in
fortune-telling. It appears that they were early used for divinatory
purposes in Europe, but according to Willshire their employment in
fortune-telling gradually declined among the upper classes until the
middle of the eighteenth century, “though it was prevalent, no doubt,
among the lower grades of society frequenting fairs and the caravans
of mountebanks. About 1750 divination through cards again became
popular in Paris, at least, for in 1751, 1752, and 1753 three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>persons were publicly known as offering their services for this intention.”
According to certain writers, the emblematic figures of the
tarot cards are of very remote origin, stretching back as far as the
ancient Egyptians, from whom they have descended to us as a book
or series of subjects of deep symbolic meaning. The discovery
and explication of the meaning of the tarots employed in modern
times was claimed by M. Count de Goebelin in 1781, who in his
“Monde Primitif analysé et compare avec le Monde Moderne,” gave
a dissertation on the game of Tarots, in which he states that the
tarot pack is evidently based on the sacred Egyptian number seven,
and reviews the tarot emblems in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>The probable origin of the 21 tarot cards has already been suggested
in connection with Chinese cards, and it is not surprising that
the astrological notions associated with Tarots should find parallels
in the speculations of the Kabbalists, who attached similar notions
to the dice throws as are now found associated with them in China,
from whence the 21 Tarot cards doubtless came to Europe. An explanation
is therefore found for some of the resemblances upon
which M. de Goebelin lays such stress. His fancies, however, never
subjected to very severe examination or criticism, were seized upon
by a perruquier of Paris of the name of Alliette, who combined with
his ordinary occupation the practice of cartomancy. He read the
dissertation of Count de Goebelin, and, thereby enlightened, changed
the letters of his name and prophesied under the name of Ettillia.
His writings furnish the basis of most of the treatises now extant
upon the subject of fortune-telling with cards, and his name is found
associated with several of the modern French tarot packs published
especially for fortune-telling, in the present collection. During the
exciting periods of the first Consulship of Napoleon I., there lived,
according to Mr. Willshire, a well-known diviner named Madame
Lenormand, whose predictions gained great repute. Her name, with
that of Ettillia, appears on the French cards here exhibited, as well
as on those made in America. Several French and German fortune-telling
packs of an amusing character are to be found in the present
collection, as well as others published in the United States, which
are designed solely for purposes of amusement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire northern side of this case is devoted to the card games
other than regular playing cards, which owe their existence to the
prejudice against cards or to the demand for simple and instructive
amusements for children and young people. Mr. Milton Bradley has
contributed some interesting notes on the history of such games in
this country. In 1843 Miss Annie W. Abbott, a clergyman’s daughter
of Beverly, Mass., offered to Mr. Ives, a publisher of Salem, Mass.,
a card game which she called “Dr. Buzby.” This game, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the first of its kind, was reluctantly published by Mr. Ives and met
with an astonishing success, no less than 50,000 copies being sold in
the following year. It will be remembered by many of the parents
of the present day as among the earliest games ever learned and
possibly played upon the sly through fear of reprimand. A pack of
the original Dr. Buzby cards will be found at the beginning of this
collection. The game of “Authors” was originated by a young
man living in Salem, helped by some of his female acquaintances.
The method of play was copied from “Dr. Buzby,” but it contained
an element of instruction and profit not found in the older game. He
took it to a local publisher to see if he could have ten or a dozen
packs printed, as it was too much work for him to print them. Mr.
Smith, the publisher, saw the possibilities of the game and told him
if he would let him make them, he would supply his needs gratis, to
which he consented. This was in 1861, and the sale of this game has
since been wonderful. Many modifications and improvements of the
original game are shown in the collection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after the publication of “Dr. Buzby,” a teacher in a young
ladies’ school in Salem devised a game of letters which has since become
popular under the various names of “Spelling Puzzle,” “Word
Making and Word Taking,” “War of Words,” “Anagrams,” “Logomachy,”
“Words and Sentences,” etc. The publications of the
Milton Bradley Company, McLaughlin Bros., and E. I. Horsman are
here exhibited, and no less than 78 different card games are displayed.
They are classified in groups according to the methods of
play, which, in spite of the ingenuity displayed in the designs of the
cards, are relatively very limited in number, the ideas in the main
being derived from games already played with regular playing cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The collection has received many additions since its installation,
notably a very complete series of Zuñi games from Mr. Cushing,
and a series of Malayan and Chinese games from H. H. the Sultan
of Johore, through Mr. Rouncesvelle Wildman, as well as an extremely
important collection of East Indian games from the Provincial
Museum, Lucknow, and of Burmese games collected by
Mr. C. S. Bayne, Rangoon, both through the courtesy of the Honorable
Charles H. T. Crosthwaite.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>NOTES AND QUERIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Folk-Lore at the Columbian Exposition.</span>—If the Anthropological
Building has been late in completion, the display is now most interesting.
The value and curiosity of the archæological exhibits will first attract attention;
but those more closely connected with folk-lore are well worthy of
notice. An account is elsewhere printed of the cases devoted to the presentation
of objects used in games. A very curious and complete exhibition
of objects connected with Chinese worship in America is made by the
Archæological Department of the University of Pennsylvania; and the
curator, Mr. Stewart Culin, shows in his own name an interesting gathering
of books used by the same people in this country. The place which
toys may be made to take in museums illustrating folk-lore is well shown
by a collection of toys representing Chinese and Japanese musical instruments
by the same exhibitors. Mr. G. F. Kunz of New York exhibits a
collection of precious stones, or valuable objects, employed as amulets, or
with superstitious purposes. The Australian display contains illustrations
of the Bora initiation ceremonies, and that of Africa representations of disguises
employed in sacred rites not yet explained. As connected with
mythology, the totem poles and carvings of the Haida of British Columbia
will be observed. In the Government Building, Mr. Frank Hamilton
Cushing has constructed a model of a Zuñi priest engaged in the celebration
of the creation-myth. Outside of the exhibition buildings, the Midway
Plaisance offers a continued spectacle of various life. The Javanese
theatre is especially to be mentioned, as worthy of description and study.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Anthropological Congress.</span>—In the end, the plan of this Congress
was so far altered that the arrangement in separate sections was
abandoned. The Congress devoted to Folk-lore but one afternoon, on
August 29, given to the Collection of Games in the Anthropological Building,
and one morning, August 31, when a certain number of papers were
presented. As these papers will hereafter appear in the proceedings of
the Congress, it will not be necessary here to give an account of them.
The attendance at the Congress, as at most of the scientific congresses,
was limited; but the occasion was found pleasant by those who took part.
Persons desirous to obtain the printed proceedings may send the subscription
price ($5.00) to Mr. C. Staniland Wake, Department of Ethnology,
Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Aldegonda, the Fairy of Joy. An Italian Tale.</span>—In a wellwritten
editorial, or leader-review, in the “London Chronicle,” of the book
entitled “Rabbit the Voodoo,” by Miss Mary Owen, the writer, in referring
to my introduction to the latter work, intimated that I could probably not
distinguish between what was American Indian and original Negro superstition
or tradition, because savage races have the same bases of custom
and belief. This view, like many others current among theorizing folklorists,
is to a great extent deceptive. What were the absolute beginnings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>of anything in Nature, only Omnipotence can tell,—yet this is what folklorists
for the most part seek, trying to dig a well with a needle, and
neglecting what is for the time being their proper work,—namely, identifying,
with given phases of culture, what belongs to each.</p>

<p class='c007'>A tradition, when it has received color, and, as one may say, size and
form, so that it manifestly belongs to a certain <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cultus</span></i>, has to the mere beginnings,
which men hunt so zealously through variants, exactly the same
proportion as some beautiful cathedral to its deeply buried foundation or
crypt. I have with my own eyes seen an English clergyman demolish the
greater portion of a very fine and well-preserved Perpendicular church, because
he had unfortunately dug out of the whitewash a solitary little, old,
and unornamented Early English window, or rather peep-hole. The whole
church was forthwith “restored” into Early English! He will not idly
read this tale—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non modicam ex hoc demetes frugem</span></i>—who will reflect that
any grubber can collect out of books and pile up variants, but that to grasp
the grandeur and glory of tradition and to feel its spirit is the real mission
of learning.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have been lately reminded of this manifest impression of time on the
form of a legend by examining several traditions which had been collected
for me, in Florence, by a woman alluded to in my “Etruscan Roman Traditions.”
She is ever impecunious, and when reduced to living on air, like
the wolves of François Villon, waylays me in the road, when a few francs
change owner, and a promise is passed that traditional folk-lore shall be
collected and written, as an equivalent. Then my agent goes about, among
old women, into Florentine slums, and out into peasant homes, and anon
delivers to me sheets of note-paper on which, in very pronounced Tuscan,
is written a tale or two, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cosa</span></i> being given as <em>chavusa</em>, and many words divided,
the first half tacked to its predecessor, and the last half to its follower, as
certain worms, when dissected, amicably unite with pieces of their neighbors.</p>

<p class='c007'>When I lately met my collector, she was, by her own account, going full
speed to utter ruin,—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad inopiam, velis remisque properat</span></i>,—with all sail
set. She had been cited to be fined by the police, her landlord had
warned her for a month’s arrears, all her clothes were in pawn,—she had
in the world only a cent, and that was counterfeit. Result—five francs
surrendered, and a week after sundry writings received.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of these was called Oldegonda (Aldegonda), the Spirit of Joy. That
there might be no mistake, the writer had put a real ivy leaf in the MS.,
partly to serve as an object lesson, and partly to aid in conjuring the
Spirit, or in attracting her favor. And thus ran the legend of Oldegonda,
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">la fata della Ellera</span></i> (<i><span lang="ast" xml:lang="ast">allegría</span></i>), or the Fairy of Joy:—</p>

<p class='c004'>Oldegonda, or Aldegonda, fairy of the country (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">della campagna</span></i>), was
found in a field when but a few days old. One day a contadino, passing by
a forest, discovered a little animal which clung to his leg, and this creature
was a hedge-hog, which led him to a mass of ivy, in which he found sleeping
a beautiful little infant girl. Taking it home to his wife, he bade her
treat it as their own child, and also be kind to the little animal,—che non
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>le maneba altro che la favella,—who needed only speech to show a human
soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the woman disobeyed her husband, and was wont to kick the hedge-hog,
and neglect Aldegonda, as the foundling had been called. For the
woman had a daughter of her own, who grew in ugliness with every year,
even as Aldegonda grew in beauty and gentleness, so that the former hated
the latter with all her heart. And one day, when they were in the woods,
the little hedge-hog led Aldegonda to the piles of ivy, where she sat in
state. But the daughter of the peasant, seized with jealous rage, that the
hedge-hog was only attentive to the other, cried,—</p>

      <div class='line'>A wizard, same as I am born!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Saying this, she seized the hedge-hog and threw him into the stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the hedge-hog was a young prince who had been cursed by a sorcerer
or witch to remain in the form of an animal, until some one should
cause him a violent death. With his fate was linked the love of Aldegonda.
Therefore, when he sank into the water, the spell was broken; he rose,
and gained the green bank of the forest, as a beautiful youth in splendid
attire. And addressing the peasant girl, he said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>And the sign of the cross must thus be made thrice, and the invocation
every time repeated.</p>

<p class='c004'>This tale, I may observe, is not of the popular traditional type of Grimm
and Perrault, but belongs to the dark lore current among witches and sorcerers,
in which the story, although always ancient, is a mere frame for the
ceremony and incantation. The marked difference between these narratives
and mere <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">märchen</span></i> is very striking, because the former are in all cases
guarded jealously, as profound and even awful secrets or formulas. I
know an English lady of Italian life, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, one born of Anglo-Italian parentage—who
has for a long time been “in with the witches,” and she has
never yet been able to get her most intimate <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">strega</span></i> to converse on sorcery,
or repeat a line of a legend, except in the open air, far away from profane
hearing. One reason for this is that all such stories, especially the incantations,
are generally sung. This is done in a very peculiar tone of voice.
It sometimes requires years to get the right intonation which renders a
certain incantation effective. Therefore, if one were to be heard singing
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">alla strega</span></i>, or in witch tunes, to a young lady, there would be a “difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>[As to our correspondent’s request for information, reference may be
made to the discussion of J. G. Frazer, in “The Golden Bough,” (Lond.
1890), ii. 140 f. The custom has been prevalent in France, as well as
in Great Britain and Ireland. In the Isle of Man, on Christmas Eve,
the wren was hunted, killed, and fastened on the top of a pole. It was
then carried from house to house, the bearers, meanwhile, chanting an
appeal similar to that above given, at the same time collecting money.
The wren was then laid on a bier and buried with much solemnity. The
rite, according to another account, is described as taking place on St.
Stephen’s Day (December 26th). The bird, in the latter case, was hung
in the centre of two crossing hoops, decorated with evergreen and ribbons.
In the song, reference is said to have been made to boiling and eating the
bird. The money collected appears to have been employed for a feast at
night. English and Irish usages were substantially identical.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the significance of the custom, it is only clear that it must have
been a survival of a sacred rite. Mr. Frazer gives Asiatic parallels, but
these are not very close, nor indeed are the accounts complete or sufficient.
His own conclusion is that the custom is the remains of a pastoral sacrament,
in which the animal god is killed and sacramentally eaten. That the
wren has in some degree a sacred character is made probable by the superstitions
relating to the bird. But the whole subject is obscure.]</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Modern Additions to Indian Myths, and Indian Thunder Superstitions.</span>—The
following remarks were made by the undersigned at the
Annual Meeting, 1892:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. On Mr. W. W. Newell’s paper, entitled Examples of Forgery in Folk-Lore:
(<em>a</em>) Some of the myths obtained from the Omahas and Ponkas
bear marks of European origin, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</span></i>, one of the Orphan who had a magic
sword and two magic dogs; rescued a chief’s daughter from a water monster;
cut off heads of monster, took the seven tongues home; black man
got heads, claimed chief’s daughter as wife; was detected and killed;
Orphan won chief’s daughter (Contra. to N. A. Ethnology, vol. vi. pp. 108–131.)
Some of the writer’s Omaha informants were French half-bloods.
(<em>b</em>) There have been modern additions made to myths. An Omaha
stated that he made up part of the myth of the Big Turtle who went on the
war-path. (<em>c</em>) When the writer was revising his material before preparing
his article on “Omaha Sociology,” he was furnished by one of the tribe (a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>prominent ex-chief, now dead,) with several riddles, that appeared in
“Omaha Sociology” as genuine Omaha riddles. Not until 1888 did he
learn by accident that the riddles in question were versions of some that
the children of his informant had read in “The Youth’s Companion”(!)
The informant was not a man to tell a wilful lie.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Remarks on Miss Alger’s papers, one being, Survival of Fire-sacrifice
among Indians in Maine: (<em>a</em>) When the first thunder is heard in the
spring the Thunder Being is invoked by the Omaha and Ponka Indians.
In the case of the former people, the Black Bear people go to the mysterious
war tent of the Elk people, whom they assist in the invocation of the
Thunder Being, whom they call “Grandfather.” When the Black Bear
people of the Ponka tribe invoke the Thunder Being on such an occasion,
they say, “Ho, Grandfather, by your brandishing (your club) you are
frightening us, your grandchildren, who are here. Depart on high.” (<em>b</em>)
The chief of one of the two Kansas war gentes, Pa-ha<sup>n</sup>-le ga-qli, gave the
writer a copy of his mystic war chart, saying that in the middle should appear
a representation of fire, but he dared not make it unless he had fasted
and prayed for several days, lest he should be struck by lightning. (<em>c</em>) No
respectable Omaha girl dare walk alone. She must go with another girl,
when not accompanied by her mother or some other near relation. Any
man, not a near kinsman, who spoke to young girls that he chanced to
meet, was sure to be punished. (<em>d</em>) With reference to the worm killed by
the Thunder, compare the Dakota belief as to the conflicts that have
occurred between the Unkteqi or Water powers (the Waktceqi of the Winnebago)
and the Wa-ki<sup>n</sup>ya<sup>n</sup> (“Flying Ones”) or Thunder Beings. These
water powers (the males) are supposed to dwell in rivers, while the females
inhabit streams that exist beneath the hills. (<em>e</em>) The legend of the Moose
Woman resembles two Omaha myths: In that of the Chief’s Son and the
Snake Woman, the latter person warns her husband against courting another
woman; when he does so, she disappears. In the story of the Man
who had for his wives a Buffalo Woman and a Corn Woman, the Man pursues
his fleeing Buffalo wife and her son; when he reaches a river, he takes
a magic plume from his hair, blows on it, and, as it is wafted across the
river, he becomes the plume, reaches the other bank, overtakes his wife
and son, and finally recovers them. (See “Popular Science Monthly,”
September, 1893.)</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Writing to the Rats.</span>—A member of my family remembers a case of

to them. Her letter was as follows: “If you don’t leave this house, I’ll
get a cat.” It seems to me as amusing, in its way, as that of the Maine

interested herself in these researches; and the minister of public instruction
has issued a circular which recommends to professors and teachers the
study of popular traditions. The society is to issue a journal, entitled
“Rivista delle tradizioni popolari italiano,” and also a series of volumes,
to be known as “Biblioteca del folk-lore italiano.” The annual subscription
will be twelve lire ($2.40); members will be permitted to obtain volumes
of the “biblioteca” at a reduction of fifty per cent. Local directors
will be appointed in the various districts of Italy; every three years a congress,
entitled “Congresso Nationale dei Folkloristi italiani,” will be held
with a view of discussing questions which relate to Italian folk-lore. Subscriptions

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c005'>NOTES ON PUBLICATIONS RECEIVED.</h3>

<p class='c006'>In the next number of this Journal, notice will be taken of the important
publications, in the field of American mythology and tradition, which
have appeared during the past half year. At present it will be possible
only to offer remarks on publications entitled to comment, dealing with
other than purely American subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a treatise entitled “Böhmische Korallen aus der Götterwelt,” Dr. F.
S. Krauss discusses, in a humorous vein, apocryphal additions to the
material of Slavic and Lithuanian mythology. “Bohemian corals” are
imitations; but, as the writer remarks, these imitations had a considerable
value, until in latter days they have themselves become the subject of imitation.
There is a manufacture of folk-lore, parallel to the production of
primitive implements. In some cases these spurious additions have been
the products of misunderstanding. An amusing case is the comment of
an expert in Celtic tongues on the inscription “Encina,” subscribed in uncial
characters on a Gallo-Roman statuette, or rather on the engraving
of the statuette. The inquirer, connecting the word with the Old Irish
“ec,” death, presumed Encina to have been the designation of a Celtic
Fate. In point of fact the name was the signature of the engraver. Among
wholesale manufacturers of mythic material, Dr. E. Veckenstedt receives
an apparently merited castigation. The latter has treated of eighty-two
personages of Lithuanian mythology; of these forty are said to have been
taken from the unreliable work of Lasicki, the other forty-two to be “original.”
Pretensions of Croatian and Bulgarian enthusiasts, anxious to
exalt the antiquity and independence of their national life, are rebuked by
Dr. Krauss. Of wider scope is the review of a work of Dr. G. Krek, professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>of Slavic philology in the University of Graz, entitled “Einleitung in
die slavische Literaturgeschichte.” Dr. Krauss comments on the errors
of method, with which the attempt is made to determine the original character
of a race by philological discussion, and observes: “He (Dr. Krek)
is not aware that the Slavic-speaking peoples are mixed races, which arose
at the earliest about the beginning of our era, out of populations in a state
of political dissolution, and which began to develop themselves on the
ruins of the culture of these populations.” (Page 104.)</p>

<p class='c007'>A very beautiful and excellently executed collection of popular Sardinian
love-songs is furnished by E. Bellorini. The editor has prefixed a bibliography,
and a preface containing an account of the forms of the verse. A
literal prose Italian version is appended, while explanatory notes treat of
difficult words and printed parallels, good indexes completing the work.
The songs are divided into two classes, dialectically called “motos” and
“battorinas,” each class being arranged in sections according to topics.
The “moto” is a peculiar stanza, in lines usually of seven syllables, containing
a theme or history (istérria), and a refrain (torrada), the latter relating,
not directly to the theme, but to the feelings of the lover. Suppose the
theme to consist of three lines, the first of these is repeated to form the
first verse of the refrain, with which the fourth line of the refrain rhymes,
while the second and third lines rhyme with the two remaining lines of the
theme; and the refrain is thrice sung, so that each line of the “history”
alternately begins a verse, while the other lines of the refrain are altered
in place, and repeated. This, at least, is one of several ways of forming
the “moto.” The “batterinas” consist of four lines, generally of eleven
syllables, of which the first and fourth rhyme, as also the second and third.
The first class of songs are preferred by women, the second, chanted to the
guitar, are usual among men. The theme is not very closely connected
with the refrain, and is often of an obscure and mystical character. The
following are examples of the “moto:” The silver bird—Who flieth and
doth not fall—with golden wings.—The silver bird—Thou art in my
heart—Though a hundred approach. Another: On a snowy mount—An
angel hath descended—To make peace in war.—On a snowy mount.—Heaven
and earth took a pledge—When they made thee. A third: On
the brink of the well—There is a stone—Inscribed with letters of gold.—On
the brink of the well.—To give thee my heart—Because of thy
desert—is my desire. The author makes just remarks on the age and
character of the songs. The language is that of the dialect, here and
there qualified by literary influences. There is nothing to prove any great
antiquity of these productions, which continue to be composed. It is to be
hoped that Mr. Bellorini may be able to continue his work, and publish the
popular Sardinian songs relating to other subjects, a task for which he has
shown himself admirably qualified.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Cries of London,” sixty-two in number, with wood-cuts, were
printed in 1799. Mr. A. Certeux, having come across this rare little work
in Switzerland, has reprinted it with the original illustrations, accompanied
by a French translation. A few notes give comparisons with cries of Paris.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>What lends especial value to the book is a bibliography of the principal
works on the cries of Paris, containing about fifty titles. This literature
begins with the thirteenth century, Guillaume de la Villeneuve having
written at that time his “Les crieries de Paris.” In 1887 V. Fournel published
a work on the Cris de Paris, which had a considerable success. It
would be interesting to learn what information exists concerning the streetcries
of England, outside of the book here reissued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the title of “Mélanges de Traditionnisme de la Belgique,” A.
Harou offers gleanings of the beliefs and superstitions of Flanders, arranged
as referring to astronomy and meteorology, the human body, popular medicine,
animals, birds, plants, etc. A certain number of legends, formulas,
and nicknames are added. The work is in part from printed sources, and
is to be regarded as a suggestion of a more complete and systematic collection,
rather than as filling the place of an exhibition of Belgian superstition.
It goes without saying that many of the items have parallels in English
folk-lore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The richness of Finland in the material of folk-lore is well calculated to
awaken the envy of collectors in other regions. The Swedish population
in Finland has its share in this survival, having kept with great faithfulness
its ancient character. According to the opinion set forth by Julius Krohn,
the popular Finnish poetry of the Kalevala has adopted essential elements
of Scandinavian mythology, while it has also been argued that folk-tales
and popular melodies have passed from the Swedes to the Finns. However
this may be, there is now a considerable literature devoted to the folk-lore
and dialect of the population in question. A Society for the Study of
Swedish Dialects in Finland, founded in 1874, is now in possession of large
collections of songs, melodies, proverbs, and tales, as well as of a great
mass of dialectic words. The literature of Swedish folk-lore in Finland is
the subject of a bibliographical notice of E. Lagus, the citation of titles
being accompanied with a descriptive notice of the books. The series begins
in 1892 with the work of A. I. Arvidsson (<span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Svenska Fornsånger</span>), and includes
about forty books or articles.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a treatise on the subject of hieroglyphic calendars, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Calendriers
à Emblèmes Hiéroglyphiques</span>,” A. Certeux describes and examines portable
calendars of the fourteenth century, a mural calendar in wood of the
fifteenth, a Breton carved calendar of the fifteenth, etc. Observations are
also made on an Aztec calendar, a Norse Runic calendar, etc. In the
course of his remarks, the writer offers observations on the different divisions
of time adopted by different races. The references are exclusively to
French sources.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a discussion of “The Thyrsos of Dionysos and the Palm Inflorescence
of the Winged Figures of Assyrian Monuments,” read before the
American Philosophical Society, Dr. C. S. Dolley of Philadelphia, Pa.,
considers that the drunken and riotous characteristics of the mysteries
were probably an addition to the original cult. The primitive use of the
thyrsus was that of a wand to be tossed about in the dance, a use to which
the stalks of the giant fennel were adapted, the festoons representing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>bindweed naturally attached to the fennel. With this garlanded rod was
combined, as he thinks, the date inflorescence found on Eastern monuments,
which was altered into the cone-like tip of the thyrsus, and by error
identified with the pine-cone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. K. Weinhold, examining the various forms of the tale of the man
who is turned into an ass, as recounted in Apuleius and in various German
and Indian <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">märchen</span>, comes to the conclusion that the story was originally
a novelette and not an alteration of a myth. He inclines to believe it
original in Greece or Asia Minor of antiquity, and thence to have been
diffused eastward and westward, and offers some remarks on the theory of
transformation, as often mentioned in folk-tales.</p>

<p class='c007'>The twenty-fifth volume of the “Journal of the China Branch of the
Royal Asiatic Society” consists of a new instalment of the “Botanicum
Sinicum” by E. Bretschneider, the first or general part having appeared
nearly ten years before. The present volume deals with Chinese names of
plants occurring in the Chinese classics and other ancient Chinese works,
and their botanical identification. Plants mentioned in the dictionary
“Rh ya” (sixth century <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>) are divided into herbaceous plants and
trees, and those mentioned in other works into cereals, vegetables, cultivated
cucurbitaceous plants, textile plants, tinctorial plants, water plants,
various herbaceous plants, fruits, and bamboos. The information from
literature, thus brought together, contains a great variety of instruction
respecting food, customs, costume, ritual, and the like. Mention of rites
seems usually provokingly inadequate, as in the allusions to the use of rice
as sacrifice for spirits, of the peach-wand feared by demons, of the male elm
pierced with an elephant’s tooth and plunged in water as injurious to the
spirits of the water, to the “shi” divining plant, the stalks of which were
used in divination, etc. In appended general remarks, Dr. Bretschneider
observes that the Chinese have never shown any inclination for exploring
nature from a love of knowledge, nor any trace of a scientific tendency.
Conspicuous is the absence of names of plants having powerful poisonous
properties. Medicinal plants appear to have been known only to a few
collectors, who kept their information strictly secret, a concealment which
led to substitution and confusion. Appended are minutes of meetings in
1890 and 1891. These contain a brief report of a paper by Dr. J. Edkins,
entitled “China Thirty-five Centuries Ago,” in which the writer sets forth
his opinion that the true foundations of Chinese civilization were laid in
the third millennium before Christ. He considered that in the Chow
period (800 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>?) religious usages of a more polytheistic form were
adopted in profusion, and the people in their customs deserted the simplicity
of ancient life. This position was criticised by Dr. E. Faber, who
remarked on the want of any reliable information respecting early Chinese
civilization, and the worthlessness of Chinese chronology and literary
criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a beautifully illustrated article, contained in the publications of the
United States National Museum, Romyn Hitchcock treats of the “Ancient
Burial Mounds of Japan.” Without touching on the strictly archæological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>matter, we may notice the account of the ancient practice of burying the
retainers of a prince standing upright around his grave, an interment in
which the partially buried persons seem to have been left to perish and be
devoured by wild beasts. The custom was changed, according to Japanese
records, in the first century of our era, and the devotion of the living
man succeeded by images, examples of which are figured in the article.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same report, Mr. Hitchcock gives an account of Shinto mythology.
The sources being especially Basil Hall Chamberlain’s translation of the
Ko-ji-ki (<span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 711?) and the review of E. M. Satow on the writings of
Japanese scholars. Casually, Mr. Hitchcock makes observations on the
connection of modern Japanese folk-lore with the old mythology; thus the
dance of Usume before the cave of the Sun-goddess is represented by the
pantomimic “kagura,” danced by young girls at the temple of Ise and elsewhere.
The mask of Usume is frequently seen in Japanese homes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interesting exhibit of New South Wales in the Columbian Exposition
displays a mass of material calculated to illustrate native customs and
life, including a set of views showing the different parts of the initiation
ceremony called the “bora.” To accompany the exhibit, the New South
Wales Commissioners have caused to be printed a handbook called “The
Aborigines,” compiled by Dr. John Fraser of Sydney. This excellent
treatise gives in conversational style a variety of information respecting the
habits, ceremonies, ideas, food, habitations, and costume of the “black
fellows,” as the race has ungracefully been called. It is difficult to speak
with patience of the absurdities and calumnies of the numerous writers who
have represented this people as raised but one degree above the animal.
It would appear, on the contrary, that the social and moral status of the
Australian does not greatly differ from that of the wilder Africans. In
spite of his cannibalism, and his low powers of numeration, on which a
very unjustifiable emphasis has been placed, the native is yet a highly intelligent
person, admirably adapted for his own method of life. Particularly
to be noted is the account given respecting religious beliefs and observances.
Dr. Fraser perceives that the “Karabari” or corroborees, the
native dances, are, in part at least, religious usages, although Australian
students of the native tribes have not as yet fully penetrated their secrets.
Without doubt some of them will be found to be religious ceremonials,
accompanied by an elaborate mythology, in that respect resembling the
dances of other “primitive” races. It is on the practices of the “bora”
that most light has been thrown: here we have the construction of moundcircles,
the occasional erection of monoliths or carved pillars, the setting
up of a sacred pole, the participation of women not admitted to the secret
rites, the presence, as it would seem, of ancestral deities, severe trials of
constancy, the reception of a sacred name, final emblematic painting with
white, probably also a regular system of instruction in tribal religion, mythology,
and ethics. Instead of being void of religious feeling and ideas, as
many observers, including the late traveller Lumholtz, have described him,
there can be no doubt that the Australian is a person continually influenced
by religious conceptions. It seems a pity that such names as “Hamites”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>and “Shemites,” with corresponding ethnological speculations, should appear
in this treatise, in which, however, these dubious theoretical elements
have no important place.</p>

<p class='c007'>A brief paper by Hon. Richard Hill, “Notes on the Aborigines of New
South Wales,” is somewhat superficial in character. The writer does not
understand that a belief in “evil spirits” must necessarily include a religious
faith and worship, but bears testimony to the natural chivalry of the
natives. The writer mentions that in case of a duel, or “fighting to the
death,” as it is called, each of the combatants invites the other to strike,
the orthodox challenge being “hit me first,” each at the same time offering
his head to be struck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rev. W. W. Gill’s observations on “The South Pacific and New Guinea,”
also printed for the Exposition, contains notes on the Hervey Islands,
South Pacific, annexed by Great Britain in 1888. The observations on
ideas and customs, although conceived in the unsympathetic spirit of the
missionary, is of great interest as indicating the rich mass of material, and
the profit to science which must ensue from a proper record of native traditions.
Baptism, marriage, death, the spirit world, etc., are themes of comment.
We hope hereafter in this Journal to find room for extracts. The
ethnographic interest of the writer may be measured by his naïve remark
that the prayers used in incantation are “happily lost”! Of ceremonial
religion the notes give no account, although the existence of a ritual is
clearly implied; but the presence of a faith full of mysticism, and parallel
to the beliefs of European antiquity, is everywhere indicated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hungarian journal, “Ethnologische Mitteilungen aus Ungarn,”
directed by A. Herrmann, after a most honorable record, was obliged to
suspend publication in its second volume. This periodical has now
resumed issue, the Archduke Joseph assuming responsibility for its continued
appearance. Dr. Herrmann will be assisted by Dr. H. von Wlislocki,
Dr. A. Katona, and others. This publication will deal with the
ethnography and folk-lore of the Magyars and connected races, and will
also become the organ of the Gypsy Folk-Lore Society, which has ceased
to publish an independent journal. An address prefixed to the new volume
of the journal, signed by C. G. Leland and D. MacRitchie, recommends
the “Ethnologische Mitteilungen” to the reception of all persons interested
in Gypsy research. Price seven francs; subscriptions may be
addressed to A. Herrmann (Budapest, 1, Szent-György utcza, 2).</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. There may be an allusion to the name in this, for O-ne-tah (the Hemlock)
means “Greens on a stick,” and O-neh-tah (the Pine) means “Porcupines clinging
to a stick.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. The old Indian comb; it was made of wild oats, long grasses like thistles,
sharp and black at the end. The Indians work these sharp ends through wool or
cotton and cut off the sharp points, leaving the grass about two inches long, like
bristles; then they take a piece of animal bladder, because it is soft, and tie the
bundle of cloth together for a handle. This old mode of making a comb has gone;
with the Indian’s present opportunity of buying combs, such as we use, it is an
impossibility, almost, to procure a specimen of these old combs.</p>
